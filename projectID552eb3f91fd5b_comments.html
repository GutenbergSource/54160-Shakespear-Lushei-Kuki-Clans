<HTML><BODY>Yet another anthropological monograph dealing with N.E. India. The subject of this book are the Lushei (or Lushai; the book explains the difference) and Kuki (or Thadou) clans, which live in what is today Mizoram (the part of India nowadays tucked in-between Bangladesh and Burma).

<p>Like the other titles in this series, you will come across several difficult things. Many tables, diagrams, and intralinear text.

<p>This book contains some bilingual text, set in parallel lines. To make this workable during PP, please add an extra line between each pair of lines (So you get a Mizo language line, then an English literal translation line, and then the extra empty line)

<p>During the F-rounds, please also add a bar symbol to separate each word or word group in the lines, such that the Mizo and English can be kept aligned, but there is no need to mark italics in those lines, so the end result will be like:

<p>(Note that the sample is not from this book, but from the monograph on the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/48706/48706-h/48706-h.htm#pb138">Mikirs</a>, and for which the final result of this in HTML can be seen at Project Gutenberg.)

<p>The few words in Assamese (in Bengali script) can be marked as [Assamese:###], I will transliterate these during PP.

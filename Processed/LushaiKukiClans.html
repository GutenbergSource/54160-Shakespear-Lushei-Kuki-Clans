<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This monograph was originally intended to deal
only with the inhabitants of the Lushai Hills, but on my transfer to
Manipur, I found so many clans living in the hill tracts of that
curious little state that I suggested that the scope of the monograph
might be enlarged to include all clans of the Kuki race as well.</p>
<p class="par">This term Kuki, like Naga, Chin, Shendu, and many
others, is not recognised by the people to whom we apply it, and I will
not attempt to give its derivation, but it has come to have a fairly
definite meaning, and we now understand by it certain closely allied
clans, with well marked characteristics, belonging to the Tibeto-Burman
stock. On the Chittagong border the term is loosely applied to most of
the inhabitants of the interior hills beyond the Chittagong Hill
tracts; in Cachar it generally means some family of the Thado or
Khawtlang clan, locally distinguished as New and Old Kukis. In the
Lushai Hills nowadays the term is hardly ever employed, having been
superseded by Lushai. In the Chin Hills and generally on the Burma
border all these clans are called Chins.</p>
<p class="par">The term Lushai, as we now understand it, covers a great
many clans; it is the result of incorrect transliteration of the word
Lushei, which is the name of the clan, which, under various chiefs of
the Thangur family, came into prominence in the eighteenth century and
was responsible for the eruption into Cachar of Old Kukis at the end of
that century and of the New Kukis half a century later.</p>
<p class="par">The Lusheis, however, did not eject all the clans they
came in contact with, many of them they absorbed, and these now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e790" href="#xd24e790" name=
"xd24e790">XIV</a>]</span>form the bulk of the subjects of the Thangur
chiefs. In this monograph Lushai is used in this wider sense, Lushei
being used only for the clan of that name. Among the people themselves
the Lusheis are sometimes spoken of as Dulian, at the derivation of
which I will hazard no guess, and the general population of the hills
is spoken of as Mi-zo. Among inhabitants of the Lushai Hills are found
a very considerable number of immigrants, or descendants of immigrants
from the Chin Hills, who are found living among the Lushais under the
Thangur Chiefs or in villages under their own chiefs. I have made no
attempt to deal with these, as their proper place is the Chin Hills
monograph, and Messrs. Carey and Tuck have already described them very
fully in their Chin Hills Gazetteer.</p>
<p class="par">I am conscious that there are many omissions in this
book; the subject is a very wide one and the difficulty of getting at
the facts from so many different clans, each speaking a different
dialect and scattered over an area of about 25,000 square miles is
extremely great. I trust therefore that my readers will excuse all
shortcomings.</p>
<p class="par">I have purposely avoided enunciating any theories and
making deductions, considering it wiser to limit myself to as accurate
a description as possible of the people, their habits, customs and
beliefs. Regarding the affinities between the clans dealt with in this
monograph and those described in the other books of the series, I
venture to express a hope that the subject may be dealt with by some
competent authority when the whole series has been published; until
this is done no finality will be reached. It would be easy to fill
several pages with points of resemblance between the different clans.
Major Playfair, in his account of the Garos, has pointed out many ways
in which the subjects of his monograph resemble the inhabitants of the
Naga Hills, but reading his book I find many more in which they are
like the clans I am dealing with. Sir Charles Lyall has drawn attention
to the evident connection between the Mikirs and the Kuki-Chin group; I
venture to think that a study of the following pages will confirm his
theory. I may mention here that the main incidents of the &ldquo;Tale
of a Frog&rdquo; given by Sir Charles are found not only in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e796" href="#xd24e796" name=
"xd24e796">XV</a>]</span>the folk-lore of the Aimol, as he has pointed
out, but also among the Lushais, a very similar story having been
recorded by Colonel Lewin in Demagri, 250 miles in an air line from the
Mikir hills, and published in his Progressive Colloquial exercises in
the Lushai dialect in 1874.</p>
<p class="par">My best thanks are due to Lt.-Colonel Cole, Major
Playfair, and Mr. Little, P.W.D., for many of the photographs, and
especially to my wife, my companion for many years in these hills, for
the four coloured illustrations.</p>
<p class="par">I am also indebted to Rev. W. K. Firminger for
correcting the second proofs and making the index. I must also
acknowledge the assistance I received from many Lushais and others,
notably Hr&#257;ngzora Chuprasie of Aigal and P&#257;thong, interpreter
of Manipur.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;On p. 6 of
the present work the Author refers to a passage in Lewin&rsquo;s
<i>Hill Tracts of Chittagong and the Dwellers therein</i>, in which is
cited an account of &ldquo;the Cucis or inhabitants of the Tipperah
Mountains written by J. Rennel, Chief Engineer of Bengal in
1800.&rdquo; In reading through the proofs of the present work, it
occurred to me that it would be important to discover whether the
&ldquo;J. Rennel&rdquo; referred to by Lewin was or was not the famous
Major James Rennell, Surveyer-General of Bengal, who is so often
described as &ldquo;the Father of Modern Geography.&rdquo; Major
Rennell with his wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jane Thackeray&mdash;a great
aunt of the novelist W. M. Thackeray) left Bengal in March, 1777, and
reached England in February 1778. He died on March 29, 1830. It seemed
to me possible that the great Rennell might have obtained the
information about the Kukis during his period of service in East
Bengal, and that he might have published a memoir on the subject in
1800. Mr. W. Foster of the Record Department of the India Office very
kindly informed me that no such a memoir could be traced at Whitehall,
and drew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e919" href="#xd24e919" name=
"xd24e919">XIX</a>]</span>my attention to Lewin&rsquo;s heading of the
memoir, &ldquo;From the French of M. Bouchesiche, who translated the
original from the English of J. Rennel, Chief Engineer of Bengal....
Published at Leipsic in 1800.&rdquo; Mr. Edward Heawood, Librarian of
the Royal Geographical Society, to whom I am indebted for much trouble
taken in satisfying my curiosity, informed me that Bouchesiche gave
what purported to be an extract, translated into French, from
Rennell&rsquo;s well-known work on India, and that the
Frenchman&rsquo;s book was printed in Paris in 1800, although there may
perhaps have been a Leipzig issue also. The account of the Kukis given
in Bouchesiche&rsquo;s work, however, is not taken from any known work
by James Rennell. Dalton in his <i>Ethnology of Bengal</i> refers to
what has been supposed to be the earliest account of the Kukis&mdash;a
memoir by Surgeon McCrea, which appeared in 1799 in Volume vii of
<i>Asiatic Researches</i>. Mr. Heawood most kindly hunted up
McCrea&rsquo;s memoir, and found in it a reference to a memoir which
appeared in Volume ii of <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, 1790. The title of
the memoir of 1790 runs &ldquo;On the Manners, Religion, and Laws of
the Cucis, or Mountaineers of Tipra.... Communicated in Persian by John
Rawlins, Esq.&rdquo; On investigation, Mr. Heawood found that the
Memoir of 1790 is undoubtedly the original from which Bouchesiche drew
his account in French, and of this the account, attributed to &ldquo;J.
Rennel&rdquo; by Colonel Lewin, is a rough paraphrase. <i>Note by the

Habitat<span class="corr" id="xd24e1033" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> The Lushei chiefs now rule over the
country between the Kurnaphuli river and its main tributary, the
Tuilianpui on the west, and the Tyao and Koladyne river on the east,
while their southern boundary is roughly a line drawn east and west
through the junction of the Mat and Koladyne rivers and their most
northerly villages are found on the borders of the Silchar district.
Within this area, roughly 7,500 square miles, there are only a few
villages ruled over by chiefs of other clans, and outside it there are
but few true Lushei villages, though I am told that there are villages
of people very closely connected with the Lusheis, on the southern
borders of Sylhet, in Tipperah and in the North Cachar Hills, and there
are a few in the Chittagong Hill tracts.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.2">2. Appearance and
physical characteristics.</span> All the Lushai Kuki clans resemble
each other very closely in appearance and the Mongolian type of
countenance prevails. One meets, however, many exceptions, which may be
due to the foreign blood introduced by the many captives taken from the
plains and from neighbouring tribes; but these are not worth
considering, and the description of the Kuki written by Lt. Stewart
close on 80 years ago cannot be improved on. &ldquo;The Kukis are a
short, sturdy race of men with a goodly development of muscle. Their
legs are, generally speaking, short in comparison with the length of
their bodies, and their arms long. The face is nearly as broad as it is
long and is generally round or square, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>cheek bones
high, broad and prominent, eyes small and almond-shaped, the nose short
and flat, with wide nostrils. The women appear more squat than the men
even, but are strong and lusty.&rdquo; In Lushai clans both sexes are
as a rule rather slighter made than among the Thado and cognate clans,
whom Lt. Stewart was describing. Adopting the scale given in the
handbook of the Anthropological Institute, the colour of the skin
varies between dark yellow-brown, dark olive, copper-coloured and
yellow olive. Beards and whiskers are almost unknown, and a Lushai,
even when able to grow a moustache, which is not often, pulls out all
the hairs except those at the corners of his mouth. The few persons
with hairy faces may, I think, be safely said to be of impure
blood.</p>
<p class="par">The hair is worn, by both sexes, in a knot over the nape
of the neck, and carefully parted in the middle. The young folk of
about the marrying age devote much care to their hair, dressing it
daily with much pigs&rsquo; fat. Later in life they grow careless, and
widows allow their hair to hang as it chooses. Children&rsquo;s hair is
left to grow as it likes till it is long enough to tie up. Curly hair
or hair with a pronounced wave in it is uncommon, and is much objected
to.</p>
<p class="par">The women are prolific, five to seven children being
about the average, but the mortality among the children is so great
that few parents can boast of more than two or three grown up
children.</p>
<p class="par">Both men and women are good walkers and hill-climbers,
which is only natural, but for a race which lives exclusively on the
hilltops the number of good swimmers is very large. Most men are not
afraid of the water, and manage rafts very skilfully, making long
journeys on them in the rains.</p>
<p class="par">Abortion is not infrequently resorted to when a widow
who is living in her late husband&rsquo;s house, and therefore, as
described later, expected to remain chaste, finds herself enceinte.
Suicide is also rather common, poison being the usual means chosen. The
cause is generally some painful and incurable disease, but very old
persons with no one to support them sometimes prefer the unknown future
to the miserable present.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.3">3. History.</span>
The existing Lushei Chiefs all claim descent from a certain Thang-ura,
who is sometimes said to <a id="xd24e1054" name="xd24e1054"></a>have
sprung from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>union of a Burman with a Paihte woman, but,
according to the Paihtes, the Lusheis are descended from Boklua, an
illegitimate son of the Paihte Chief Ngehguka. The Thados say that some
hunters tracking a serao noticed the foot-marks of a child following
those of the animal, and on surrounding the doe serao they found it
suckling a child, who became the great Chief Thang-ura, or, as they
call him, &ldquo;Thangul.&rdquo; From Thang-ura the pedigree of all the
living chiefs is fairly accurately established. The Lusheis, in common
with the Thados and other Kuki tribes, attach great importance to their
genealogies; and pedigrees, given at an interval of many years, and by
persons living far apart, have been found to agree in a wonderful
manner. From comparison of these genealogies and from careful enquiries
lasting over many years, I estimate that Thang-ura must have lived
early in the eighteenth century. His first village is said to have been
at Tlangkua, north of Falam. It is probable that he personally ruled
over only a small area. From him sprang six lines of Thang-ur
chiefs:&mdash;(1) Rokum, (2) Z&#257;deng, (3) Thangluah, (4) Pallian,
(5) Rivung, and (6) Sailo. To the north the country was occupied by the
Sukte, Paihte, and Thado clans. These appear to have been firmly
established under regular chiefs; but to the west the hills appear to
have been inhabited by small communities formed largely of blood
relations and probably each at feud with its neighbours. Therefore when
want of good jhuming land and the aggressions of the eastern clans made
it necessary for the Thang-ur to move, they naturally went westward.
The Rokum, the eldest branch, are said to have passed through the hills
now occupied by the Lushais, and some of their descendants are said to
be found on the Tipperah-Sylhet border. The Z&#257;deng followed the
Rokum, and, passing through Champhai, moved westwards and about 1830
ruled some 1,000 houses divided into four villages situated near the
banks of the Tlong or Dallesari river, round the Darlung peak. In
alliance with Sailo chiefs of Lalul&rsquo;s family, they attacked and
defeated successively the Hualgno (a Lushei family settled between Tyao
and Manipur rivers) and the Pallian, who were their allies against the
Hualgno. Subsequently the Z&#257;deng quarrelled with Mangpura, then
the most powerful Sailo chief, who, dying about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>that time,
bequeathed the feud to his relatives, one of whom, Vutaia, prosecuted
it with such vigour that the Z&#257;deng, in spite of an alliance with
the Manipur Rajah&mdash;who, however, proved but a broken
reed&mdash;had to flee southwards, and their last independent village,
numbering only 100 houses, broke up on the death of the chief, which
<span class="corr" id="xd24e1060" title=
"Source: occured">occurred</span> at Chengpui, near Lungleh, about
1857. The Z&#257;deng chiefs are reputed to have been cruel and
arbitrary rulers, whose defeat was not regretted even by their own
followers. Their descendants have retained these qualities, and, in
spite of much assistance, have failed to regain their position in the
world.</p>
<p class="par">The Thangluah and Rivung took a more southerly course.
The latter penetrated into what is now the Chittagong Hill tracts, and
a chief named Vanhnuai-Thanga had a very large village on the Longteroi
hill, between the Chengri and Kassalong rivers. He died about 1850, and
shortly after his death the village was destroyed by Vutaia. The
remnant of the Rivungs fled to Hill Tipperah, where Liantlura, a
great-grandson of Vanhnuai-Thanga, had a village up till a few years
ago, and there is one small hamlet under a Rivung chief in the Aijal
sub-division of the Lushai Hills.</p>
<p class="par">The Thangluah penetrated as far as Demagri and Barkhul,
where Rothangpuia (Ruttonpoia) became known to us, first as a foe, and
then as a faithful ally. Rothangpuia&rsquo;s son Lalchheva, fretting at
our control, moved his village across our boundary, in spite of a
warning that Government could on no account protect him if he did so.
Very shortly after this move he was attacked by Haus&#257;ta, a Chin
chief, and his village totally destroyed, many persons being killed and
more taken captive. All the mithan (tame bison) were driven off and the
chief escaped with little more than the one cloth he was wearing, and
now the once prosperous Thangluah clan is represented by only a few
poverty-stricken hamlets round Demagri.</p>
<p class="par">The Pallian followed the same route as the <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e1070" title="Source: Zadeng">Z&#257;deng</span>. The
best known chiefs of this clan are Sibuta (Sheeboot) and Lalsuktla
(Lalchokla). Sibuta is said in Mackenzie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eastern
Frontier&rdquo; to have thrown off the Tipperah yoke with 25,000
houses. He died close to Aijal, and his memorial stone is at the first
stage on the Aijal-Lungleh road. It is extremely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>doubtful
whether he ever was really subject to Tipperah, though it is certain
that all these Lushai clans had dealings with the Tipperah Rajahs and
feared them greatly. Among the tales in <a href="#ch1.5">Chapter V</a>.
will be found one which exemplifies this.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lalsuktla</i> (Lal chokla), captured by Captain
Blackwood in 1841, was a <span class="corr" id="xd24e1082" title=
"Source: greatgrandson">great-grandson</span> of Sibuta&rsquo;s.
<i>Purbura</i> is said to have been a very powerful Pallian chief and
at one time to have received tribute from almost all his contemporary
Thangur chiefs. He had a large village, said to contain 3,000 houses,
on the Dungtlang, whence he moved as far westwards as Pukzing, where
his village was destroyed by a combined force of Z&#257;deng, Sailo,
and Chuckmahs. This attack took place somewhere about 1830. Purbura
rebuilt his village, but died soon after, and his descendants were
attacked frequently by the chiefs of the Rolura branch of the Sailo
family, and now only two small hamlets, close to Aijal, remain to
remind us of this once powerful clan.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>Sailo</i>.&mdash;These chiefs are descended from
Sailova, a great-grandson of Thang-ura&rsquo;s. They came into
prominence last, but have crushed all their rivals, and have developed
such a talent for governing that they hold undisputed sway over
representatives of all sorts of clans, over nearly the whole of the
area now known as the Lushai Hills.</p>
<p class="par">This great family has often come in contact with the
British Government, but from the fact that our dealings with them have
generally been through illiterate interpreters, they appear in our
records under various names. The Howlongs, who caused much anxiety on
the Chittagong frontier from 1860 to 1890, Lalul&rsquo;s descendants,
whose doings fill the records of Silchar for nearly a century, Vonolel,
Savunga, and Sangvunga, against whom the two columns of the Lushai
Expedition of 1871&ndash;72 were directed&mdash;all these were
Sailos.</p>
<p class="par">As above remarked, it seems most probable that the
country into which the various Thangur chiefs moved, under pressure
from the Chins, was almost entirely occupied by small communities
having no power of cohesion. The greater part of these were absorbed,
and now form the majority of the subjects of the Thangur chiefs; but
some fled north and west into Manipur, Silchar, Sylhet and Tipperah,
where they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>known as Kukis and where their appearance caused
much trouble, as, from the very nature of the cause of their migration,
much ill-feeling existed between them and the triumphant Lushais. In
Stewart&rsquo;s notes on Northern Cachar, it is stated that the Old
Kukis made their appearance in Cachar about the end of the eighteenth
century. These Old Kukis include the Biate (Beteh) and Hrangchul
(Rhangkol) and other cognate clans who are now known to us as
Khawtlang. They claim the hills round Champhai as their place of
origin, and the sites are still known by their names. We have seen that
the Lusheis claim to have sprung from a village south-east of Champhai,
and that the Z&#257;deng passed through Champhai on their westward
move, which ended so disastrously for them. The advance of such tribes
would be slow, and would be largely regulated by the rate at which they
exhausted the cultivable land near their village sites; therefore the
appearance of the Biate and Hrangchul in Cachar at the beginning of the
nineteenth or end of the eighteenth century fits in well with the date
I had assigned for Thang-ura, the first Lushei chief, before I had read
Lieutenant Stewart&rsquo;s book. These Khawtlang clans to this day have
little power of cohesion, and they naturally gave way at once before
the well-organised Lushais, and fled north and north-west into Cachar
and Manipur, passing through the territory of the Thado clans and
suffering considerably at their hands. When the Thangur had firmly
established themselves, and the capable Sailo chiefs had come to the
front, they felt equal to fighting the Thado clans, which were as
highly organised as themselves. The Sailo chiefs triumphed, and hence
the eruption of the New Kukis, alias Thados, and cognate clans, into
Silchar about 1848.</p>
<p class="par">In Colonel Lewin&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Hill Tracts of
Chittagong and the Dwellers Therein,&rdquo; page 109, is given an
account of the &ldquo;Cucis or inhabitants of the Tipperah
mountains,&rdquo; written by J. Rennel, Chief Engineer of Bengal in
1800. With very slight alterations, this account is applicable to the
Lushais of to-day, and I have no doubt that the Cucis therein described
were the Rivung, the advance-guard of the great Lushai invasion.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the Chittagong side, we find, as early as 1777,
records of frontier disturbances ascribed to &ldquo;Kookies, men who
live far in the interior parts of the hills, who have not the use of
firearms, and whose bodies go unclothed<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e1104" title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> (Lewin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Hill Tracts of Chittagong and the Dwellers Therein,&rdquo;
page 21). These Kukis were allies of the Chuckmahs, and we have seen
that about fifty years later the Chuckmahs joined with the Z&#257;deng
and the Sailos in an attack on Purbura.</p>
<p class="par">The various branches of the Sailo family were frequently
at war, the cause almost invariably being a dispute as to land. About
1856 a war, known as &ldquo;The War of the North and the South,&rdquo;
broke out and lasted about three years. The Northern combatants were
the descendants of Lallula, their opponents being Cherra&rsquo;s
family. The bone of contention was the Piler hill, and this quarrel was
on the point of breaking out again in 1892, when Mr. McCabe and I,
appearing on the scene from Aijal and Lungleh respectively,
&ldquo;frightened both the heroes so they quite forgot their
quarrel.&rdquo; The war ended in a victory for the North, who surprised
Konglung, a village on the top of a very precipitous rock, and captured
the young chief and his mother, who later were ransomed for many
necklaces.</p>
<p class="par">In 1874 the Southern Lushais fell out with the
Thlantlang (Klangklang) chiefs. Vandula, head of the Lushais, had
raided Vaki, a village on the Arracan border, and brought away as part
of the loot a brass bowl and a big earthenware vase, which the
Thlantlang chief claimed as being part of the promised price of his
daughter, who had recently been married to the son of the Vaki chief.
As Vandula refused to give up the articles, the Thlantlangs attacked a
Lushai piquet on the Koladyne, killing some men. To revenge this
insult, the Lushais attacked Bunkhua, with disastrous results, as is
described in <a href="#ch1.3.5">Chapter III, Para. 5</a>, and had to
make an ignominious peace.</p>
<p class="par">Later the Northern chiefs quarrelled among themselves,
and the war of the East and West broke out and lasted several years.
The cause is said to have been a girl called Tuali, for whose
affections Liankhama and Khalkhama were rivals. It is unnecessary to go
into the history of our dealings with the Lushais, which have ended in
the whole of the Hills being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>annexed, and a stop put to all such
wars, but when we occupied Lungleh in 1889 we found the F&#257;nai clan
coming into prominence, and there is little doubt that, but for our
intervention, that clan would shortly have attempted to eject the
Southern Lushai chiefs.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.4">4.
Affinities.</span> The Lushais are more or less closely allied to all
the tribes now living in their vicinity, but some who show this most
strongly, such as the Chiru, Kom, Aimol, are now settled in the Manipur
State, while the intervening country is occupied by clans belonging to
the Thado, Paihte, and Khawtlang families, which, though no doubt of
the same stock, are more distantly connected. It seems certain that the
former clans lived near the Lusheis when the Thangur commenced their
victorious career, and it may well be that it was fear of absorption by
their more powerful neighbour that drove these clans northwards, while
the Lusheis took a westerly direction.</p>
<p class="par">The connection between the Lusheis and their eastern
neighbours is apparent both in their language and in their customs, but
the eastern tribes, known to us generally as Chins, are of finer
physique and, owing to their having permanent villages, the differences
between clans have become more marked than among the semi-nomadic
Lushais and Kukis. The feuds between different clans, which are always
found where permanent villages exist, tend to widen the breach between
communities and to accentuate every accidental variation of custom, so
that the common origin is soon lost sight of. Nevertheless there is no
doubt that the Kukis, Chins, and Lushais are all of the same race.</p>
<p class="par">Less apparent but still quite traceable is the
relationship between the Lushais and the Kabuis and Manipuris, though
the latter nowadays try in every way to disown all connection with
their poor relations.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.5">5. Dress.</span>
The men&rsquo;s dress could not well be simpler, consisting as it does
of a single cloth about 7 feet long and 5 wide. It is worn as
follows:&mdash;One corner is grasped in the left hand, and the cloth is
passed over the left shoulder, behind the back, under the right arm
across the chest and the end thrown over the left shoulder. Although it
would appear probable that clothing so loosely worn would be
continually falling off, yet, as a matter of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>fact,
accidents of that sort seldom occur. In cold weather, one or more
cloths are worn, one over the other, and also a white coat, reaching
well down the thigh but only fastened at the throat. These coats are
ornamented on the sleeves with bands of red and white of various
patterns. When at work, in hot weather, the Lushai wraps his cloth
round his waist, letting the ends hang down in front, and should he
find the sun warm and if he is wearing two cloths, he will wear one as
a puggri. Puggris are sometimes worn when out in the sun for long, and
some affect rather a quaint style, twisting the cloth round the head so
as to make an end stand up straight over each ear.</p>
<p class="par">All these garments are of cotton, grown locally and
manufactured by the women of the household. The cloths in general use
are white, but every man likes to have two or three blue cloths
ornamented with stripes of various colours.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushais have a very strong objection to getting
their heads wet, and therefore in the rain wear hats made of strips of
bamboo or cane plaited and lined with smoked leaves. The original hats
were almost flat and circular, but nowadays these have been discarded
in favour of very clever imitations of helmets and solar topis. In the
southern portion of the district the people use, as a protection from
the wet, a large shallow basket-work tray, shaped like an oyster shell,
and made waterproof by being lined with smoked leaves; the narrow end
rests on the wearer&rsquo;s head, while the broad end reaches down well
below the waist, so that, while bending down weeding in the jhum, the
head and body are kept dry. This form of waterproof is not much used in
the northern portion of the Lushai Hills, but is common among the Chiru
and other allied clans in Manipur. As the Lushai has no pockets, he
carries, wherever he goes, a haversack made of some pretty coloured
cotton cloth slung over his shoulder by a strap of the same material.
In this he carries his flint and steel and his tobacco, in neatly made
boxes carved out of solid pieces of wood and fitted with lids of the
same material, or of leather moulded into shape by being stretched over
a block. His pipe is generally in his mouth; it consists of a bowl made
out of a particularly hard kind of bamboo which is only found in the
Chin hills&mdash;whence the Lushais claim to have sprung&mdash;with a
long stem made of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>reed-like variety of the same plant. When not
in his mouth, this also reposes in his haversack along with his
&ldquo;tuibur,&rdquo; a small gourd to hold the water which has been
impregnated with nicotine in the pipe of his wife or sweetheart. A
little of this evil-smelling concoction he takes into his mouth from
time to time and, having kept it there a few minutes, he spits it out
and declares that it has a stimulating effect. In his haversack you
will also find his knife, the wooden sheath tied to one of the shoulder
straps so that the handle is always convenient to his hand. The blade
is about four or five inches long and nearly an inch wide at the
handle, but comes to a sharp point; the edge is straight and ground
like a chisel.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The dress of the chiefs is the same as that of the
common people, except on occasions of ceremony, when they wear dark
blue cloths, with red lines of a particular pattern, and plumes, made
of the tail feathers of the king-crow, in their hair knots. These
plumes are very much prized and are kept most carefully in bamboo tubes
with leather caps. The cloth referred to above can also be worn by
anyone who has given certain feasts, as described later on.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Dress in War-time.</i>&mdash;When the Lushais were
fighting us in 1892 I was much struck by the whiteness of their
garments. The men who ran away from the stockades as we rushed them
were always dressed in nice clean coats and cloths, and crowds of
similarly attired warriors used to assemble every morning just out of
range and challenge us to come and fight. I was told that it was
considered the correct thing to come properly dressed when there was
fighting on hand, but a raiding party I once came across was dressed
far more suitably. A single cloth wrapped tightly round the waist, a
haversack protected by a bear or tiger skin guard over one shoulder,
and a fighting dao or dah over the other, and a gun in his hand
completed each warrior&rsquo;s equipment. It will be seen from the
above description that the Lushais are not fond of dress, and this is
another point in which all Kuki clans differ from those of Naga
stock.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Special Attire.</i>&mdash;A man who has earned the
title of &ldquo;Thangchhuah&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> Chap. IV, 9) is allowed
to wear a cloth of a certain pattern and those who have killed men in
war have special head-dresses, known as &ldquo;chhawndawl&rdquo; and
&ldquo;arke-ziak.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par"><i>The Women&rsquo;s Dress.</i>&mdash;The women are no
more addicted to fine clothes than their men-folk. All women wear the
same costume; a dark-blue cotton cloth, just long enough to go round
the wearer&rsquo;s waist with a slight over-lap, and held up by a
girdle of brass wire or string, serves as a petticoat which only
reaches to the knee, the only other garments being a short white jacket
and a cloth which is worn in the same manner as the men. On gala days
the only addition to the costume is a picturesque head-dress worn by
girls while dancing. This consists of a chaplet made of brass and
coloured cane, into which are inserted porcupine quills, and to the
upper ends of these are fixed the green wing-feathers of the common
parrot, tipped with tufts of red wool. At the back is affixed a
horizontal bar from which hang strings of glistening wing covers of
green beetles. The women smoke as much as the men and have a special
form of pipe, a miniature hookah about 9 inches high with a clay bowl,
the water container being of bamboo much ornamented with patterns
roughly scratched. The water when thoroughly impregnated is transferred
to the &ldquo;tuibur&rdquo; gourd of some male relative or admirer.
Children of both sexes begin smoking very young. I have seen a woman
take her pipe from her mouth and put it into that of the baby on her
back.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.6">6.
Tattooing.</span> This is not much practised. The only patterns
employed are circles on the forearm and breast, which are said to be
mementoes of love affairs in happy bachelor days, and rude
representations of a metna&rsquo;s head, which is said to have no
particular meaning.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.7">7. Ornaments worn
by men.</span> The Lushai wears a variety of articles in his hair knot.
The commonest is a brass two-pronged pin with a head shaped like a G.
The prongs are drawn out to sharp points and vary in length from three
to eight or nine inches. These very long pins are a recent innovation,
and their use seems to be restricted to the young dandies of the
hamlets round Aijal. Skewers of ivory, bone, and metal about six or
eight inches long are also worn. Of the two former there are two
patterns, one four-sided, about a quarter of an inch thick at two
thirds of its length, tapering to a point at each end, the other being
flat, pointed at one end and about half an inch broad at the other.
Both are ornamented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>with engraved circles and lines. The metal
skewers are quite plain and more for use in scratching the head than
for ornament; a piece of the rib of a broken umbrella is now often
used. The hair comb is also an ornamental article; it consists of a
piece of ivory or wood about three inches long, half an inch thick and
an inch or so wide, into which are inserted, very close together, teeth
of strips of bamboo about two inches long. If the back is of wood it is
generally crescent-shaped and lacquered red and inlaid.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Photo by Lt. Colonel H. G. M. Cole,
I.A.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">With reference to the comb I may quote from Colonel
McCulloch&rsquo;s descriptions of the Thados in his &ldquo;Account of
the Valley of Manipur&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;Their attention to
genealogy, the distinction of clans, and the respect paid to seniors, I
have already noticed. Out of this may have sprung the only
exclusiveness shown by the Khonjai (Thado), namely, in the point of who
would be entitled to use his comb and whose comb he might use. This,
though amongst them a very important matter, I cannot find to have any
religious importance attached to it, but there is an indication of the
superior rank in respect of descent or by connection, or of estimation
in which an individual is held or holds himself to be found to whom he
would refuse his comb, or amongst whom his comb is common.&rdquo; My
Lushai informant says that the use of the comb is restricted, as
headaches are communicated by the comb. He also adds, &ldquo;A higher
clan man is contaminated by a lower clan man using his comb. Thus a
Renthlei may not use a Sailo&rsquo;s hair comb, and a Chawngthu may not
use that of a Pallian.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Earrings.</i>&mdash;Most men have their ears pierced,
and wear either small wooden studs, with flat heads about half an inch
in diameter, and coloured red, or cornelians suspended by a piece of
string. The stones are barrel-shaped and unpolished, the surface being
pitted with minute holes and circular marks. These are valued very
highly, and are passed on from father to son, or given as a
daughter&rsquo;s dowry. Some of them have names connecting them with
some story of bygone days. These naturally fetch higher prices. I know
of stones valued at Rs. 400/-.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Necklaces.</i>&mdash;Both sexes are fond of
necklaces: those of amber <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>are most valued, and any that have
histories attached to them fetch prices which to us seem absurd. I
remember a chief, who was offered Rs. 60/- for his necklace, replying
that if the Sahib wanted the necklace he would give it him, but that he
would not sell it for Rs. 1000/- as it had been the property of his
ancestors. The old necklaces are made of very dark amber, beautifully
clear, and the beads are sometimes two to three inches long and over an
inch in diameter. There is some doubt as to where these beads came
from, but it is probable that they came through the Chin hills from
Burmah. Besides amber, agate, cornelian, and various sorts of bead
necklaces are worn, or, failing all these, white shirt buttons are
acceptable.</p>
<p class="par">A tiger&rsquo;s tooth is often hung round the neck as an
ornament and is also thought to have magical properties. The young
dandies are fond of hanging round their necks tufts of white
goat&rsquo;s hair bound together with red thread; these are now worn as
ornaments, but undoubtedly the custom arose from the idea that cures
are effected by hanging round the affected part a piece of the skin or
feathers of the animal or bird sacrificed to the demon, who is thought
to be responsible for the illness.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Bracelets</i> are not much worn and are generally
plain brass rings.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ornaments Worn by Women.</i>&mdash;With the exception
of their earrings, the Lushai women affect the same ornaments as the
men. The earrings, however, are quite distinct, and, in order to be
able to wear them, much preparation is necessary. When quite a child
the girl has her ears pierced, and small wooden plugs are inserted.
These are replaced by larger ones, which in turn give place to still
larger ones of clay, the size of which is gradually increased till the
real earring, which is an ivory disc some inch or inch and a half in
diameter, with a hole in its centre, can be inserted. Widows remove
their earrings, and slit the lobes of their ears when they abandon all
thought of re-marrying.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.1.8">8. Weapons.</span>
The Lushais have been in possession of firearms for the last sixty or
seventy years. These weapons are flint-locks bearing the names of many
European makers; many are Tower muskets, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>and guns bearing the
marks of the French Customs Department are not at all rare. These guns
came into the country in the first instance chiefly through Burmah,
though no doubt some came through Chittagong, and much money must have
been made, for the demand was large. When the weapons first began to
appear, the Lushais and other western tribes used to obtain them from
the tribes on the Burmah border, giving slaves in exchange, a strong
male slave being equivalent to two guns. The other weapons in use are
spears and dahs. The former are inferior weapons with iron laurel-leaf
shaped blades about a foot or fifteen inches long, very insecurely
attached to the shaft, which is of hard wood, often a piece of sago
palm; at the other end of the shaft is a long iron spike which is stuck
into the ground when the user halts. A special spear is used for
sacrificial purposes, the blade of which is much longer and
diamond-shaped. The spike at the other end is also much elongated, so
that sometimes the wooden shaft is only six or seven inches long. The
dah is a more serviceable weapon, being copied, as its name
&ldquo;kawlnam&rdquo; denotes, from the Burmese weapon, but the blade
is shorter, the handle is of wood lacquered black and red, and
ornamented with brass bands and a brass knob at the end. In former days
oblong shields of bison-hide eighteen inches wide and about two feet
long, adorned at the two upper corners with tassels of goat&rsquo;s
hair dyed red, were carried. The upper half of the shield was sometimes
covered with discs of brass, while from a string crossing the centre of
the shield hung a row of brass cones about two inches long, from each
of which depended a tassel of red goat&rsquo;s hair, reaching to the
base of the shield. Bows and arrows have entirely gone out of use, but
were formerly used, especially in the chase, when the arrows were
poisoned. The bows were small and made of bamboo, the string being of
bark. The arrows were furnished with barbed iron points, and were
carried in a bamboo quiver with a leather cap to it. Among weapons we
must class the bamboo spikes with which a retreating foe or villagers
expecting an attack rendered the ground almost impassable to a
bare-footed enemy. These spikes were of two kinds, one used round the
village or block house, and the other, carried in a neat little
cane-work quiver, and stuck in the path when returning from a raid to
delay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>pursuit. The former were simple bamboo spikes of
various lengths, while the latter were carefully smoothed bamboo spikes
about six inches long, and no thicker than a knitting needle; each sort
was nicked so that it might break off after entering the flesh. To a
bare-footed foe these spikes form a very serious obstacle, and even our
troops have suffered from them, the spikes being sometimes long enough
to reach to a man&rsquo;s knee. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"

Occupation.</span> The entire population may be classed as
agriculturists, as only a few people, as will be afterwards described,
live on contributions of rice given them in exchange for services
rendered to the community. There are no shop-keepers, and, except the
blacksmith, no craftsmen, each household being capable of existing on
its own labours. The men build the house and cut the jhum, they help in
the weeding and harvesting, and procure fresh meat by their skill in
setting snares and hunting. Periodically they visit the nearest bazar,
often a journey of several days, to purchase salt and the few
requisites that their own industry cannot produce, consisting chiefly
of brass cooking pots, iron to be made into daos or finished daos.
Nowadays, it is true, the wants of the people are slowly increasing,
and looking-glasses, umbrellas, needles, and Manchester goods are
finding their way into the most remote villages. The women folk fetch
the wood and water, cook the food and do the greatest part of the
weeding and harvesting; they also make all the clothing for the whole
household from cotton grown in the jhums, which they themselves gather,
clean, spin, and weave into strong cloth.</p>
<p class="par">A Lushai woman has to rise early, fill her basket with
empty bamboo tubes, and trudge off before daylight down to the spring,
which is generally some way down the hill, and the supply of water is
frequently so scanty that it takes her some time to fill her bamboos.
Having conveyed her basketful to the house, she has to set to work
cleaning the rice for the day. The necessary amount of unhusked rice
has been dried the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span>previous day on the shelf over the hearth,
and this she now proceeds to pound in a mortar in the front verandah,
and winnow on an oval bamboo tray till it is clean enough for use. The
breakfast of rice has then to be cooked, and by the time it is ready
her husband is awake. After the meal the real work of the day begins.
In the cold weather the women settle themselves to some of the
operations connected with clothmaking, while the men prepare to pass a
day of complete enjoyment, lying in the sun and smoking, the younger
ones combining this with courting any of the pretty clothmakers; while
the children play around entirely uncontrolled, save when a
shrill-voiced mother calls one of them to assist her in some domestic
operation. About noon there is a meal of rice and herbs, after which
work is resumed and continued till the evening, when the housewife has
to make another journey to the spring, and on her return the pigs must
be fed with a mixture composed of rice husks and a species of edible
arum bulb, mashed and boiled together, the fowls enticed into their
baskets, and finally the family collected for the evening meal, which
varies little from the two previous ones, but some garnish, a little
meat, dried fish, or some savoury vegetable is generally added. As soon
as it is dark, all the female members of the family gather round the
hearth, and carry on such work as can be carried on by what light they
can get from the fire; though in villages near fir forests some pine
splinters are generally kept handy for use when an extra bright light
is required for a few minutes. The men either gather in the
&ldquo;zawlbuk&rdquo; or in some house where there is drink going, but
the young bucks sneak off to court their lady loves, which the
girls&rsquo; parents give them every facility for doing. In the other
seasons of the year, that is from March to December, the people are
engaged in their jhums from the morning to the evening meal, as is
described later on.</p>
<p class="par">Lushai parents are very fond of their children, and
fathers are often seen carrying their infants about. In times of
scarcity, what rice can be got is reserved for the young children, the
rest of the people living on yams, jungle vegetables, and the pith of
the sago palm. The children assist their parents as much as they can,
tiny girls accompanying their mothers to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>spring,
and bringing up one or two bamboos of water, while the lads help their
fathers in cutting the jhum. No one, however, takes any care of
children, and they are allowed to run about the village as they like,
in all weathers, which no doubt accounts largely for the heavy
mortality among them, as their clothing is of the scantiest.</p>
<p class="par">Teknonymy is very common. The parents of a child called
Thanga will generally be known as Thanga-Pa and Thanga-Nu, and I have
come across old widows whose real names were unknown. There is a strong
and general dislike among all Lushais to saying their own names. When
we first occupied the hills, a man would not tell you his name; if
asked he would refer to someone else and say, &ldquo;You tell
him.&rdquo; The following explanation, given me by a Lushai, seems to
me scarcely satisfactory:&mdash;&ldquo;Lushais are shy of saying the
name of their father and mother and their own names. Because it is
their own name they are shy of saying it. Some people are shy because
their names are bad. Their parents&rsquo; names&mdash;because they are
their parents they never call them by their names, therefore they are
shy of saying them. Their own names also they never say; just for that
reason they are shy of saying them. The names of their brothers and
friends they are always saying, therefore they are not shy of saying
them.&rdquo; Long ago another explanation was given me. When a man
kills another, he calls out his own name: &ldquo;I, Lalmanga, have
killed you!&rdquo; so that the spirit of the dying man may know whose
slave he will be in Mithi-Khua, the dead man&rsquo;s village; it was
suggested that it was unlucky to say one&rsquo;s name on less important
occasions.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.2">2. Weights and
Measures.</span> In every village there is a small flat basket, the
size of which is fixed by the chief, which is used for all retail
dealings in rice and such goods, but large quantities are measured by
the number of loads, a load being about 50 lbs. After the harvest the
unhusked rice is piled in a conical heap. A Lushai will tell you that
his crop is &ldquo;chhip-zawn,&rdquo; that is, the heap is level with
the top of his head; &ldquo;silai-zawn,&rdquo; that is, level with the
end of his gun held up perpendicularly over his head. This is about a
record crop; lesser quantities are denoted by the height of his hand or
hoe or axe held up. Time he measures <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>by the time a pot of rice
takes to cook&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, about an hour&mdash;or by the time he
can hold a sip of nicotine in his mouth; he has terms for each period
of the day, denoting the usual occupation; he also divides the year
according to the agricultural occupation proper to it. Terms expressing
measures of length are very numerous. Short lengths are expressed by
reference to the human body, as we speak of a span; but the Lushai has
sixteen or seventeen of these, extending from
&ldquo;chang-khat&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from the tip to the first
joint of the first finger&mdash;to &ldquo;hlam,&rdquo; which is the
distance a man can stretch with both arms extended. Longer distances he
expresses by terms such as the distance of the nearest jhum, the
distance of the furthest jhum, the distance a mithan will wander during
the day, the distance a man can travel before his mid-day meal,
&amp;c.&mdash;terms which, though well understood by the people, are a
little perplexing to strangers. Measures of weight are scanty; a
curious one is &ldquo;chuai&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as much as can be
supported if suspended from the tip of the first finger palm downwards.
Many of the stars and constellations have received names; most of them
have some story attached to them. The months are lunar months, and some
have names, but these are but little known or used.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.3">3.
Villages.</span> The Lushai likes to perch his village on the top of a
ridge or spur, partly because, hillsides being steep, it is difficult
to find sites elsewhere, partly for the sake of the climate, but
chiefly, I think, in order to get a good defensive position. His
migratory habits disinclining him to make the elaborate defences over
which the Chins, Nagas, and other dwellers in permanent villages took
so much pains, he therefore sought for a site which was difficult of
approach. When we first occupied the country, every village was
surrounded by one or more lines of stockade made of timber, with
several rows of bamboo spikes outside it. At each gateway was a block
house, and others were built at suitable places on the roads along
which enemies were expected to come, and were occupied whenever an
attack was apprehended. Tradition speaks of villages of 3,000 houses,
and, though this is probably an exaggeration, still from an examination
of the sites it is evident that they must have been very large, and
even when we occupied the country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>villages of 400 and 500 houses
were not uncommon, and there were two or three of 800 houses.</p>
<p class="par">Now that all fear of being raided has gone for ever,
people no longer feel the need of living together in large communities,
and the size of villages is steadily decreasing. The peculiar vagabond
strain in the blood of the Kuki-Lushai race, if not controlled, leads
to villages splitting into hamlets and hamlets sub-dividing, till in
the Manipur Hills we find single houses in the midst of dense jungle,
several miles from the next habitation. This could never happen among
tribes belonging to the Naga group, with whom intense love for the
ancestral village site is a leading characteristic. A short distance
outside the village by the roadside there generally are several
platforms of logs with posts round them adorned with skulls of animals,
gourds, rags, and old pots. These are memorials of deceased heroes, and
will be more fully dealt with later on.</p>
<p class="par">The gate itself was composed either of two large slabs
of timber, or of a number of stout saplings suspended from a cross bar
by holes cut through their upper ends; during the day these were drawn
aside, but at night they hung perpendicularly in the gateways and were
firmly secured between two cross bars. Passing through the gate, one
finds oneself in a sort of irregular street leading up to the highest
point of the village, where there is generally an open space, from
which other streets branch off. On one side of this space will be the
chiefs house, with the &ldquo;zawlbuk,&rdquo; or bachelors&rsquo; hall,
opposite it. The villages of powerful chiefs are beautifully laid out
in regular streets which follow the natural features of the ground.
When Colonel Lister in 1850 captured the village of Shentlang he was so
impressed with the regularity with which the villages within sight were
laid out that he was easily led to believe these were cantonments
inhabited solely by warriors. If the village is a large one and
contains a mixed population, it is divided into several quarters, or
&ldquo;veng,&rdquo; which are generally inhabited by people of the same
clan, and each will have its zawlbuk, a large building constructed by
the united labour of the men of the veng or the village. As the mithan
or gyal (tame bison) belonging to the village pass the night under the
zawlbuk, it is generally built on rather a steep hillside, so that the
natural fall of the ground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>may allow ample room for the animals
under the raised floor and ensure good drainage. It is built, as are
all other buildings in the village, of timber and bamboos, tied
together with cane and thatched with either cane leaves or
grass&mdash;if the former, then the ridge of the roof is straight and
gable-ended; if the latter, it is far higher in the centre, whence it
curves down somewhat abruptly to each gable. Access to the building is
obtained by a platform of rough logs at the uphill end, where the front
wall commences some 3&frac12; feet above the platform. Having stooped
under this wall you are confronted by a low matting partition,
surmounted by a huge log, the whole some 3 feet high, over which you
scramble and find yourself in a large bare room varying from 15 to 50
feet long and 15 to 30 feet wide, according to the size of the village,
with a square earthen hearth in the centre on which a few logs are
always smouldering, and at the far end is a raised sleeping platform
extending the whole width of the building. The young boys of the
village have to keep up the supply of firewood for the zawlbuk, this
duty continuing till they reach the age of puberty, when they cease
sleeping in their parents&rsquo; houses and join the young men in the
zawlbuk. Until that time they are under the orders of the eldest or
most influential boy, who is their &ldquo;hotu,&rdquo; or
superintendent. The zawlbuk is the particular property of the unmarried
men of the village, who gather there in the evening to sing songs, tell
stories, and make jokes till it is time to visit their sweethearts,
after which they return there for the rest of the night. Travellers not
having any friends in the village use the zawlbuk as a rest-house, but
eating and drinking are seldom, if ever, carried on there. The zawlbuk
is an institution common to many tribes, but among the clans I am
dealing with it is confined to the Lushei and the clans most nearly
allied to them. Its appearance among the Chiru and Vaiphei emphasises
the close connection between these clans and the Lusheis.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Zawlbuk, or Young Men&rsquo;s
House.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The houses all abut on the street, but small gardens are
often found at the back, in which sugar cane, beans, cucumbers,
&amp;c., are grown. The houses of the chief&rsquo;s advisers and
wealthy men are generally grouped near his, but should the chief have
more than one wife, or should he have some less fortunate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>relations dependent on him, their houses will be
found scattered through the village, each forming a centre of a quarter
or a veng, from the inhabitants of which the chief allows them to
collect the dues, which are his by right.</p>
<p class="par">The steepness of the hillside is no obstacle to house
building, and frequently the roof of one house will be lower than the
floor of the one immediately above it. The Lushais have been nomadic
ever since their ancestors started on their western trek some 200 years
ago. The method of cultivation which they follow is very wasteful, and
a large village soon uses up all the land within reach, and then a move
becomes imperative. Their custom of burying their dead within the
village tends to make a site unhealthy, especially as the water supply
is usually so situated as to receive the drainage of the village, and
when the rate of mortality rises unduly high, a move is at once made.
In old times these moves were often of considerable
length&mdash;sometimes as much as two or three days&rsquo;
journey&mdash;and sometimes a halt for a whole season would be made at
some temporary site, the people living in huts alongside their
cultivation. The selection of a new site is a matter of much thought,
and before a final decision is arrived at, a deputation of elders is
sent to sleep at the proposed site, taking with them a cock. If the
bird crows lustily an hour before daybreak, as all good cocks should,
the site is approved of. Sites of villages which have been burnt by
enemies are eschewed as unlucky, and a chief when re-occupying a site
of some other chief&rsquo;s village generally tries to establish
himself slightly to one side or other, in hopes that the new site will
bear his name for many years.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as the move has been decided on, arrangements
are made for cutting the jhums near the new site, and during the rains
all the workers live either in the jhum houses, or in temporary
shelters built near the new site, to which, after the harvest, they
laboriously carry all their belongings on their own backs, as they own
no beasts of burden. These constant moves have had a great share in
moulding the Lushai character, for when you have to carry all your
worldly goods from your old to your new house every four or five years,
it is not strange if you are disinclined to amass more than is
absolutely necessary, and gradually become content with very little,
and prefer ease and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>idleness to toiling in the hopes of being
able to add to your worldly possessions. This I believe to be the
explanation of the difference between the Lushai and the Chins, the
latter being eager to earn money by work or trade, while the former far
prefer to lie smoking in the sun.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.4">4. Houses.</span>
The house of a commoner consists of three parts, the front verandah,
approached by a rough platform of logs, the main room, and a small
closet partitioned off at the far end, beyond which there will
sometimes be a small bamboo platform. The verandah is termed
&ldquo;sum-hmun,&rdquo; from the &ldquo;sum,&rdquo; or mortar in which
the paddy is cleaned, which has its place here. On one side the careful
housewife stacks her firewood, and the front wall of the house is the
place on which the householder, if he is a sportsman, displays the
skulls of the animals and birds he has slain; among them hang baskets
in which the fowls lay, and even sit on their eggs, hatching out as
numerous and as healthy broods as do the most pampered inhabitants of
model poultry farms. The fowls spend the night in long tubular bamboo
baskets, hung under the eaves, access to which is gained by climbing up
an inclined stick from the front verandah. Hens with broods are shut up
each night in special baskets with sliding doors.</p>
<p class="par">From the verandah a small door, about 2&frac12; feet by
4, with a very high sill, opens into the house. This door is placed at
the side furthest from the hill, and consists of a panel of split
bamboo work attached to a long bamboo which slides to and fro, resting
in the groove between two other bamboos lashed on to the top of the
sill, in which there is generally a small opening, with a swinging
door, for use of the dogs and fowls when the big door is closed.
Immediately inside the door, in one corner, are collected the hollow
bamboo tubes which take the place of water pots; opposite will often be
a large circular bamboo bin containing the household&rsquo;s supply of
paddy. Next to this is a sleeping platform, known as
&ldquo;kum-ai,&rdquo; beyond which is the hearth of earth, in the
centre of which three stones or pieces of iron are fixed, on which the
cooking pot rests. The earth is kept in its place by three pieces of
wood, that in front being a wide plank with the top carefully smoothed,
which forms a favourite seat during cold weather. The earth is put in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>wet and well kneaded, and eventually becomes as
hard as brick. Along the wall an earthen shelf serves the double
purpose of keeping the fire from the wall and affording a resting place
for the pots. Over the hearth are hung two bamboo shelves, one above
the other, on which to-morrow&rsquo;s supply of paddy is dried, and
various odds and ends are stored. These shelves also serve to keep the
sparks from reaching the roof. Beyond the fireplace is another sleeping
place, called the &ldquo;kum-pui&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, big
bed&mdash;which is reserved for the parents, while the young children
and unmarried girls use the kum-ai; the bigger boys and young men, as
has already been stated, sleeping in the zawlbuk. Beyond the kum-pui
comes the partition dividing off the small recess used as a lumber
room, and often as a closet. The beds and hearth are always on the side
of the house nearest to the hillside, and do not usually extend quite
to the centre, the rest of the floor being vacant, and, in order to
avoid obstructing this, the posts which support the ridge are placed
slanting, passing through the floor in line with the edge of the
hearth. Along the wall opposite to the hearth are lashed two or more
bamboos, forming convenient shelves, while a platform of the same
useful plant is constructed from one cross beam to another. Forked
sticks tied to the wall or to the uprights form hooks, and the large
bamboos, wherever used, have openings cut in them which convert each
joint into a tiny cupboard. At the far end of the house, opposite the
front door, is a similar door opening on to a small platform, whence a
notched log serves as a means of descending to the garden or the
street. Many houses have bamboo platforms adjoining the front verandah,
on which the women folk sit and do their weaving, while the young men
lie at their ease and flirt with any girls who are good looking.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The houses of the chiefs are very similar to those of
their subjects, only a good deal larger. Entering from the front
verandah, the visitor finds himself in a passage running along one side
of the house, off which open several small rooms inhabited by the
married retainers; the other end of the passage opens into a large room
with several sleeping platforms and sometimes two or more hearths, but
otherwise similar to that above described. Beyond this is the usual
closet, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>beyond that is a wide verandah partially closed
in, which is especially reserved for the chief&rsquo;s family. These
verandahs, called &ldquo;b&#257;z&#257;h,&rdquo; are forbidden to all
except chiefs or wealthy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>persons who have given certain
feasts. A similar prohibition exists regarding windows, which are one
of the prerogatives of the &ldquo;Thangchhuah,&rdquo; as will be
described in <a href="#ch1.4.1">Chapter IV, para 1</a>. Openings in the
side of the house are viewed with suspicion, as likely to bring
misfortune, and a most progressive chief told me he had refrained from
making any but the authorised ones, in deference to the strong public
feeling that the whole village would suffer for such an innovation.</p>
<p class="par">The materials of which all the buildings are constructed
are the same&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, timber for uprights and cross beams,
bamboos for the framework of the floor, walls, and roof, split bamboos
for the floor, walls, and if cane leaves are used to cover the thatch;
the whole being tied together with cane. The uprights consist of
sections of hard wood trees, which are split longitudinally and left to
season for as long as possible. The cross beams which rest on the wall
plates appear to us unduly heavy, while the wall plates seem very weak.
The Lushais claim that the weight of the cross beams gives the house
stability in high winds. The broad bands of split bamboo laid on top of
the cane leaf thatch from eave to eave, secured at intervals by
longitudinal bamboos tied down with cane, give the roof a semi-circular
appearance from the outside. When cane leaves cannot be obtained,
thatching grass is used, but its extreme inflammability makes it
unpopular. When cane leaves are used, holes for the passage of cane
ties cannot be avoided, and beneath each of these a bamboo split in
half is secured as a drain pipe to convey the drippings beyond the
walls.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.5">5.
Furniture.</span> Owing to their nomadic habits the Lushais have not
much furniture. Even in the houses of powerful chiefs but little will
be found but a few rough and low wooden stools, some wooden platters,
some earthenware beer pots, strengthened by plaited cane coverings,
some brass pots, and many baskets in which valuable or perishable
articles are preserved. Property which can be safely buried is often
concealed in this way, a custom which is fast dying out now that raids
are things of the past.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.6">6.
Implements.</span> <i>Agricultural.</i>&mdash;The Lushai&rsquo;s
cultivation being confined to cutting down the jungle, burning it, and
dibbling in the seed among the ashes, he does not require many or
elaborate implements <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>and is content with a dao, an axe, and a hoe.
The dao is a knife with a triangular blade, about 3 inches wide at the
end and 1 inch or so at the handle. It is ground with a chisel edge,
the broad end being also sharpened. This is used for clearing the
jungle, and the broad end is used for grubbing the holes in which the
seeds are placed. The axe heads are of iron only about 1&frac12; inches
wide at the edge, and taper almost to a point; the handles are simply
pieces of bamboo, the heads being thrust through the tough root
portion. The hoes very closely resemble the axes, the heads being a
little lighter and broader.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Musical Instruments.</i>&mdash;The commonest are
gongs and drums, but a kind of mouth-organ known as
&ldquo;rotchem&rdquo; and a fiddle made out of a piece of bamboo are
sometimes used. The gongs are mostly imported from Burma, as much as
Rs. 150/- being paid for large ones, but the most prized are sets of
three small gongs, each with a separate note, on which three skilled
performers can produce something resembling a tune. The drums are
sections of trees hollowed out, the ends being covered with metna hide
caps laced together. The rotchem, which is found in all Lushai-Kuki
clans, consists of a gourd into which nine hollow reeds are inserted,
one to serve as a mouthpiece; the others, which are of various lengths,
have small holes cut in them. The performer blows into the mouthpiece,
and, by closing and opening the holes with his fingers, he can produce
various notes, but the music is dull and monotonous. The fiddle is a
very rough affair, produced in a few minutes by loosening a strip of
the outer skin of a bamboo, without detaching it at its ends, and
raising it up and inserting a piece of stick to act as a bridge; the
bow is made out of another piece of bamboo. The sound of a bugle is
very cleverly imitated by blowing through several lengths of bamboo
inserted one into the other.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Household Utensils.</i>&mdash;Besides the articles
enumerated under furniture, earthenware cooking pots and bamboo spoons
complete the utensils used inside the house.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.7">7.
Manufactures.</span> <i>Basket Work.</i>&mdash;This is chiefly carried
on by men. The patterns are very numerous, each being adapted to some
particular use. The material is generally bamboo. The
&ldquo;thul&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span>is a basket with four short legs, about
twelve inches square at the bottom, widening till the mouth is a circle
with a diameter of about thirty inches; this basket is supplied with a
conical lid and is chiefly used to keep valuables in. The outer layer
is of finely split bamboo closely woven, and this is lined with broad
leaves well dried, which are held in their place by an inner layer of
bamboo more loosely woven. These baskets are quite waterproof.</p>
<p class="par">For carrying goods there are the &ldquo;deron,&rdquo; a
truncated cone 30 to 36 inches long with a diameter at its mouth of
about 24 inches, holding about 50 lbs. of paddy; the &ldquo;em,&rdquo;
similar to the deron, but about half the size. The
&ldquo;bomrang,&rdquo; an open-work basket with an oval mouth, 15
inches by 12, is used for carrying goods on long journeys. The
&ldquo;paikawng&rdquo; similar in shape to the em, but with open-work
sides, is for conveyance of wood, water tubes, &amp;c. There are also
several sorts of flat baskets for holding grain, each with its
particular name. The containing power of these is approximately
constant, and they are used as measures of quantity.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The women make clay pots, moulding
them by hand. There are only two kinds in use&mdash;a small circular
pot with a mouth some 6 to 8 inches in diameter, used for cooking, and
a large jar, about 24 inches high and 15 inches in diameter, tapering
to about 9 inches at the mouth, which is used for brewing beer in.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Brass Work.</i>&mdash;Occasionally one comes across
rough specimens of moulding in this metal, which show considerable if
untrained talent, but they are very rare, and I attribute them to
captives taken from the plains of India or Burma, or to persons who
have learnt from them. The method followed is to make a model in wax
and cover it with successive washes of clay till a sufficient thickness
is obtained, the whole then being baked till the clay is hard, and the
wax has all run out through a hole left for this purpose. Into this
mould the molten brass is then poured. The commonest use of this work
is for the semi-circular tube required to connect the two arms of the
syphons used in drawing off the rice beer. These tubes are sometimes
surmounted by quite elaborate designs, a hunter approaching his quarry,
a tree with many hornbills perched among the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>boughs,
and on one which I bought are represented Vutaia and his
&ldquo;kawnbawl,&rdquo; or minister, with leg irons on. The latter
carries on his shoulder an elephant&rsquo;s tusk, which formed part of
the ransom of his master, who, in the ups and downs of the troublous
times in which he lived, had been captured by the Kamhaus.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Iron Work.</i>&mdash;The blacksmith is one of the
village officials described in <a href="#ch1.3.2">Chapter III, para.
2</a>. The forge is placed in the middle of the widest street to lessen
the risk of fire; it is only a rough shed with a log platform in front,
which is as favourite a resort for loafers as is the forge door in
England. The bellows consist of two hollow wooden cylinders in which
pistons fringed with feathers are worked up and down. The lower ends of
the cylinders are buried in the ground, side by side, and from them two
bamboo tubes converge, meeting just behind a stone through which there
is a hole; the charcoal fire is placed in front of this stone, and when
the pistons are worked smartly a very strong draught is obtained. The
blacksmith does little more than make and repair the simple
agricultural implements of the village, but I have heard rumours of
some who are capable of making gun locks. I think the form of bellows
and the art of working iron have been introduced by captives, as the
same type of bellows is found in the adjoining plains.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Cloth Manufacture.</i>&mdash;Cotton is grown in the
jhums. It is cleaned in a home-made gin, consisting of a frame holding
two wooden rollers, one end of each being carved for a few inches of
its length into a screw, grooved in the opposite way to the other, so
that on the handle being turned the rollers revolve in opposite
directions, and the cotton is drawn between them, the seeds being left
behind. The cotton is then worked by hand into rolls a few inches long,
whence it is spun into the spindle of a rough spinning wheel, or
occasionally a bobbin is used, which, being given a sharp twist, draws
the cotton into a thread by its own weight. This method admits of
diligent ones spinning as they go to and from their jhums. The thread
having been spun, it is thoroughly wetted and then hung in loops some
three or four feet long over a horizontal bar, and stretched by several
heavy bars being suspended in these loops. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par"><i>Weaving.</i>&mdash;The warp is prepared by passing
the thread round two smooth pieces of wood, one of which is fastened to
two uprights, while the ends of the other are attached to the ends of a
broad leather band, which passes behind the back of the weaver as she
sits on the ground and, by leaning back, stretches the threads to the
requisite degree of tightness. The woof is formed by passing to and fro
bamboos round which are wound different coloured threads, which are
beaten home with a well polished batten made of the sago palm.</p>
<p class="par">A very serviceable form of quilt called
&ldquo;puanpui&rdquo; is made by passing round every fourth or fifth
thread of the warp a small roll of raw cotton and drawing both ends up.
A row of these cotton rolls is put in after every fourth or fifth
thread of the woof, so that on one side the quilt is composed of
closely placed tufts of cotton.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Dyeing.</i>&mdash;The commonest dye is obtained by
boiling the leaves of the Assam indigo (<i>Strobilanthes
flaccidifolia</i>). Many immersions are required to render the colour
permanent, and as the plant, which is cultivated near the villages or
in the gardens, does not grow luxuriantly, it is seldom possible to
obtain enough leaves in any one year for more than two immersions, so
that the whole process may take two or three years.</p>
<p class="par">Several red and yellow dyes are known, but they are
little used, and most of the thread, excepting the blue and white, is
obtained from the bazars.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ornamentation.</i>&mdash;Cloths are ornamented almost
entirely by lines of different colours. White cloths have blue and red
stripes down the centre and sometimes one transversely about a foot
from either end. Coloured cloths are mainly blue, with stripes of red,
yellow, and green. Zigzags are not uncommon, and short lengths of this
pattern are placed haphazard on cloths and coats. The stems of
women&rsquo;s pipes are ornamented with spirals and coils.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.8">8. Domestic
animals.</span> The most valued animal is the mithan; these tame bison
wander all day at will in the jungle round the village and towards dusk
return spontaneously, each animal going to its owner&rsquo;s house,
round which it loiters till it receives a little salt, after which it
joins the rest of the herd under the zawlbuk. The animals are only used
for slaughter. They interbreed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>freely with the wild mithan, and
the hybrids are, I believe, not sterile. The other domestic animals are
pigs, goats, fowls, and dogs. The pigs are the scavengers of the
village, but are generously fed on a species of arum and rice husks
boiled together. The fowls are of a small breed; pure white, brown, and
black are the commonest colours, but there is also a handsome spangled
breed. The dogs have bushy tails, which curl tightly. Dogs are eaten
freely, but their chief value is derived from the demand for
sacrificial purposes. The goats are splendid animals with long silky
hair and very large horns.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.9">9.
Agriculture.</span> The only form of agriculture practised is that
known to us generally as jhuming, and it consists in felling a piece of
jungle and when it has completely dried setting fire to it. The ground
is thus cleared and manured by the ashes at the same time. Timber which
is not entirely burnt is dragged to the side of the plot and made into
a rough fence to keep deer out. The surface of the jhum is lightly hoed
over and then there is nothing more to be done till the gathering
clouds warn the cultivator that the rains are about to break, then
everyone sallies out, each with a small basket of seeds slung over one
shoulder and the square-ended dao in hand. Line is formed at the lower
end of the clearing, and the whole family proceeds slowly upwards,
dibbling shallow holes with their daos and dropping into each a few
seeds. It is considered very lucky to get well soaked while sowing. The
chief crop is rice, but the maize, ripening as it does in August, is
eagerly looked for by the improvident Lushais who have probably used up
more rice than was prudent in the manufacture of beer. The rice does
not ripen till November or December, though a little early rice is
grown which ripens in September. Between the sowing and the end of the
rains in October the crop requires constant weeding, a duty which falls
on the women folk if the family contains enough of them. In each
clearing a small house is built, well raised off the ground, in which
the cultivators stay during the time the work is heaviest. The other
crops grown are millet, Job&rsquo;s tears, peas, and beans. Tobacco and
cotton are also grown for home consumption. The rice is cut very high
as the straw has no value. It is threshed on a piece of ground
specially levelled near the jhum house. Threshing is done in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>two or three ways. The ears are thrown on to the
threshing floor and trodden out by persons dancing on them, or are
beaten with sticks till the grains have all fallen out. Both these
methods are rather wasteful, and a better one, which is much used in
the northern part of the hills, is to construct a platform about 7 or 8
feet from the ground on which a circular bamboo bin is fixed, into
which the ears of rice are thrown and a young man with a girl as a
companion dance merrily among them, singing all the while, the split
end of the bamboos of which the platform is made keeping up a cheerful
clatter. The grain is quickly separated from the ear and falls in a
golden cone on to the threshing floor, whence it can be easily
collected and stored in large round bins in the jhum houses or in
specially built granaries in some sheltered nook at a convenient
distance from the village.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Jhuming is certainly a very wasteful method of
cultivation, as seldom more than two crops are taken off the same piece
of land, which is then allowed to lie fallow till it has again become
covered with jungle, which will take three or four years in the case of
bamboo, and seven to ten if the jungle be trees. Tree land is said to
give better crops, but the labour of felling is greater than in the
case of bamboo and more weeding is required, and if the land is jhumed
too frequently the trees give place to coarse grass, which the Lushais
refuse to jhum, whereas bamboos only grow thicker for cutting.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.10">10. Hunting and
fishing.</span> All the hill men are very fond of fresh meat, and are
clever at trapping game. Long lines of rough fencing are run through
the jungle, with small openings at intervals, in which snares are set.
Pheasants, jungle fowl, &amp;c., coming to one of these fences will
always run along it till an opening is found, and thus get snared.
Porcupines are killed by a bamboo spear fastened to a sapling bent back
like a spring alongside a run and so arranged that it shall be released
just as the animal is opposite the spear point. Tigers are caught under
a platform of heavy logs, which is supported in an inclined position by
a strong cane passed over a cross piece held up by two uprights. In a
hole under this platform is placed a pig in a basket; on the tiger
pulling at the basket the heavy platform falls and squashes him, while
the pig, being in a hole, escapes. Deer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>wild cats, &amp;c., are
caught in snares, a noose being arranged so that on the animal&rsquo;s
stepping in it a sapling to which the noose is attached, and which is
held down in a bent position, is released, thus hoisting the animal up
into the air. The method of releasing the bent sapling or causing the
platform to fall is in all cases the same. Two uprights are driven into
the ground and a bar securely tied across near their tops. The string
or rope which supports the platform or keeps the sapling in a bent
position has a wooden toggle tied to it. The string is drawn between
the uprights and one end of the toggle is hitched under the bar and the
other end drawn down between the uprights until it is perpendicular, in
which position it is held by a movable piece of wood being slipped
across the uprights, just behind its lower end. In this position the
pull of the string is on the upper cross bar, and a very slight touch
will remove the lower one and set the toggle free; then up goes the
string and down comes the platform or the noose is tightened. The
removal of the lower bar is achieved in several ways. The bait or one
end of a string stretched across the run may be tied to it, or it may
be made to support one end of a tiny platform, on which the unwary
quarry treads as it passes.</p>
<p class="par">Pitfalls constructed in former times for the capture of
elephants are found all over the hills, generally on a narrow ridge
between precipices. To catch monkeys some rice is placed on a small
platform at the end of a partially severed bamboo standing at a right
angle to the hillside. The monkey, attracted by the rice, springs on to
the platform and is precipitated on to a number of bamboo spikes which
have been stuck in the ground beneath it. The same device with suitable
alterations is sometimes employed to destroy tigers and bears.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushai is also very fond of shooting, and with his
old flintlock accounts each year for a good number of bears and tigers.
If a village is much troubled by a tiger systematically waylaying its
livestock, a general hunt is ordered, guns are borrowed from the
neighbours, and the tiger, having been tracked into a piece of jungle,
is approached by a shouting mob, from which he flies. Every effort of
his to turn from the path selected for him is defeated by well posted
crowds, who turn him back with shouts and beating of drums, till,
wearied out, he comes to bay and falls <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>a victim to a volley from
all the guns present, but before he dies he has often severely mauled
several of his tormentors.</p>
<p class="par">Large hunting parties make lengthy expeditions into the
uninhabited parts in search of elephants and wild mithan. To kill an
elephant with their flintlocks is not an easy task. A volley is fired
at the selected animal, which is then followed for days, being fired at
when an opportunity occurs, till it falls from sheer exhaustion. The
following graphic account of an unsuccessful hunt was written for me by
a Lushai. The Kongpuishiam and funeral ceremonies will be described in
the proper place further on.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When Hmongphunga&rsquo;s village was at Kanghmun,
they intended to go out shooting. They performed the Kongpuishiam
ceremony; they placed the ashes in the middle of the road. Early next
day they went and looked at them, and in the ashes they saw the
footmarks of a tiger, an elephant, and a man. They started on the
hunting expedition, carrying plenty of rice with them. They certainly
found the elephants and fired a volley at one of them. One of the party
was called Hrangkunga. The elephant ran away. They found it in a narrow
ravine. Hrangkunga was about to shoot at it from above when the earth
gave way and he rolled down close to the elephant, which picked him up
and carried him to a level place close by, and threw him down and
trampled on him and broke up his gun and powder horn. His friends fired
at the animal, and it went off; they could not kill it. When the
elephant had gone they took up Hrankunga and buried him close by in the
jungle, and set out for their village, near which they shot a tiger.
When the people in the village heard of their approach they came out to
meet them with &lsquo;zu.&rsquo; The hunters wrapped up grass and
leaves in a cloth to represent the corpse of their friend. Outside the
village they fired guns and put down the effigy, which was buried by
the elders of the village. Shortly after this they went out shooting
again, and after going some way they saw Hrangkunga&rsquo;s ghost on
the branch of a tree and were very frightened, and went
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fishing is carried on with the ordinary casting net, and
fish are sometimes killed with spears or daos by torchlight, but most
reliance is placed on the &ldquo;ngoi.&rdquo; This is a weir built of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>timber and bamboos reinforced with stones, which
stretches from side to side of the river. At one side an opening is
left through which the water rushes with great force into a long bamboo
shoot, which curves slightly upwards and ends in a deep receptacle,
also of bamboo. The fish are carried into this by the force of the
water which escapes between the bamboos, and are unable to leap out.
Close by is placed a hut, well raised off the ground, in which the
fishermen live for several days at a time and smoke the catch. Any
chance openings in the weir are closed with conical baskets which
detain small fish, prawns, &amp;c. These weirs are constructed by the
united labour of the whole village, and any villager can make use of
them, but he has to pay a toll in kind to the chief. Certain spots are
peculiarly adapted for these weirs, and each is by prescriptive right
the property of the village occupying a certain site in the vicinity,
any infringement of which will lead to a serious quarrel.</p>
<p class="par">Deep pools in the smaller streams are sometimes poisoned
by having a decoction of a certain herb called &ldquo;kokur&rdquo; or
of a bark called &ldquo;ru&rdquo; poured into them. This stupefies the
fish, which float to the surface and are easily captured. The mixture
is said to be harmless to human beings or cattle.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.11">11. Food and
drink.</span> The Lushai when speaking of food always means rice.
Though he is fond of meat and likes vegetables and seasonings, he only
considers them as a garnish to his rice. When a mithan is killed to
feast the village, the flesh is boiled in earthen pots in the street
and the contents emptied out on to plantain leaves, whence the feasters
help themselves with their fingers, washing down the savoury morsels
with the water in which they have been boiled, but this banquet in no
way takes the place of the regular meal of rice.</p>
<p class="par">Flesh of all animals is eaten, and is not objected to
even when considerably decomposed. The flesh of leopards and tigers is
only eaten by children, but in spite of many enquiries I have been
unable to ascertain why adults abstain from this article of diet. Rats
of the white-bellied variety are considered a luxury. Dogs, especially
puppies, are a favourite dish. Next to rice, maize may be considered
the most important staple. It is eaten boiled, never being ground into
flour. Besides the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>grains and herbs which he grows in his jhums,
the Lushai finds many edible roots and herbs in the jungle. The young
shoots of the bamboo are by no means unpleasant eating, and a salad of
those of the sago palm is quite a luxury, while the pith of the latter
is much eaten in times of scarcity. When a large animal has been killed
at any distance from the village the flesh is cut into strips and dried
over a slow fire, after which it remains edible, according to Lushai
ideas, for a very long time. Boiling is the only culinary art
known.</p>
<p class="par">As regards his drink, the Lushai has very simple tastes.
With his meals he drinks nothing but the water in which the food has
been boiled, which he sips sparingly, washing the meal down with a
draught of cold water. Intoxicating drinks he only takes when he has
full leisure to enjoy them and in company with a party of friends.</p>
<p class="par">There are two kinds of such drinks, both home-made, from
rice. The commonest is known as &ldquo;zu,&rdquo; and is a simple
partially fermented drink; the other, called &ldquo;rakzu&rdquo; or
&ldquo;zuthak,&rdquo; is distilled. This is very seldom used, being
only made on special occasions. The still is a very simple contrivance,
generally consisting of an earthenware pot on the top of which a gourd
is fixed securely, the joint being made airtight with rags and clay;
through the top of the gourd is passed a bamboo which is swathed in
rags which are kept wet so as to condense the vapour from the pot. Zu
is a very important article with these people. It is required for the
due observance of every ceremony; a child&rsquo;s birth is an occasion
for entertaining its relations, no marriage can be celebrated without
the consumption of zu, while after his death a Lushai&rsquo;s friends
and relatives drown their sorrow in all the zu they can obtain.</p>
<p class="par">Has a demon to be propitiated, the return of a raiding
or hunting party to be celebrated or a friend to be welcomed, in every
case zu is indispensable.</p>
<p class="par">Good zu takes some time to prepare. After being well
bruised, paddy is damped and packed away in several layers of leaves
and kept for some months&mdash;the longer the better. When the zu has
to be brewed the bundles are opened and the contents placed in a large
earthen jar and well pressed down, with a layer of leaves on top, and
the jar filled up with water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>After standing a few minutes the
liquor is drawn off by a syphon into a brass or wooden bowl, out of
which it is handed round to the guests in horns or small bamboos. The
principal guest is served first, and as he tosses off the cup he names
the one in whose honour he drinks, who in duty bound must drink next,
naming another to follow him. While the important personages are thus
ceremoniously entertaining each other the rank and file sitting round
in a circle are each in turn receiving a brimming horn full. As the
supply in the jar gets low, more water is added, so that the quality of
the liquor steadily deteriorates. Occasionally, instead of drawing off
the zu, a tube is inserted and each toper in turn sucks up his
allowance, the appearance of the top of a peg, inserted in the layer of
leaves, giving him a hint when to leave off.</p>
<p class="par">Should the zu not have been kept long enough, a cake of
yeast prepared from rice may be required to start fermentation. Well
prepared zu is by no means an unpalatable drink. It contains much
nourishment, and Savunga, one of our opponents in the 1871&ndash;72
expedition, whom I found still living in 1898, was said to have taken
little else during the last two years of his life. The drink naturally
varies much in strength, but even at its strongest it is not very
intoxicating, and it has not the exciting effect which the drink brewed
from maize and millet seems to have on the eastern tribes, among whom
violent crimes, committed during drinking bouts, are very common.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.2.12">12.
Amusements.</span> The songs which the folk seem never tired of singing
are slow, solemn dirges sung by the whole party to the accompaniment of
a drum or gong, and are generally in praise of some former home of the
tribe or some departed hero.</p>
<p class="par">The dances also are very slow and monotonous. A single
male performer enters the circle of drinkers and postures slowly,
keeping time to the drum or gong. There are one or two exceptions, such
as the dances in which the performer imitates a monkey or a bird, but
generally speaking they are most uninteresting.</p>
<p class="par">The men are fond of putting the weight; the stone used
is a light one weighing 10 to 12 lbs. and the thrower is allowed to
follow on as much as he likes. Jumping and running races are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>never indulged in, and, though I have often
prevailed on the young men to try, the results were always very
poor.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushais are very badly off for games. Girls play a
game with a large, flat bean, called &ldquo;koi.&rdquo; The players
divide into two parties, each in turn placing their kois in a row on
the ground to serve as a target for those of the other party, which are
held between the thumb and first finger of the left hand and propelled
by the middle finger of the right. Should the target not be struck the
first time, each firer goes to where her koi lies and again aims at the
target, but this time the missile has to be propelled in another
manner. Sometimes it is placed between the knees and jerked forward by
a sharp jump, or it is balanced on the cheek or forehead and then
projected by a jerk of the head, or it may be balanced on the instep
and kicked towards the mark. This game is played among the Manipuris,
who call it &ldquo;Kang sanaba.&rdquo; The koi bean of the Lushai is
called &ldquo;kang&rdquo; by the Manipuris, but the latter now usually
use round discs of ivory instead of the natural bean.</p>
<p class="par">A game played by both sexes is &ldquo;Vai lung
thl&#257;n.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1540src" href=
"#xd24e1540" name="xd24e1540src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The players sit on the ground on opposite sides of two
parallel rows of shallow holes. In each row there are six holes and in
each hole five small stones are placed. Each player in turn picks up
all the stones in any hole in the row nearest him and, commencing from
the hole next on the left, drops one in each hole along his row and
then back along that of his opponent. If at the end of a turn one or
more of the holes last dropped into is found to contain only one stone,
the player removes these single stones and places them aside. The game
continues till all the stones have been thus removed, and the winner is
he who has taken most. Counting the stones in the hole before removing
them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge
accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the
number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number
of holes with single stones in them. This game, under the name of
&ldquo;Mancala Bao&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warri,&rdquo; is played by the
Negroes in many parts of Africa, but on elaborately carved boards.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<p class="par">Boys and young men are very proficient with the pellet
bow, and many a bird and squirrel falls victim to the sun-dried pellets
shot from their bamboo bows, with strings of cane. The other amusements
of the children consist chiefly in imitating their elders, the building
of model houses forming a favourite pastime. Swinging is also popular,
the swing consisting of a creeper suspended from the branch of a tree
or from two poles stuck in the ground and tied together at the top. The
swinger holds on to the end of the creeper, or places one leg through a
loop, or sits astride a big knot tied at the end of it. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.1">1. Internal
structure.</span> The population of a village ruled by a Thangur chief
at the present time is composed of representatives of many tribes and
clans, which have all more or less adopted the language and customs of
their rulers. I have already described the rise of the Thangurs and the
process by which they either ejected or absorbed into their communities
the other inhabitants of the country.</p>
<p class="par">Our arrival in the country put a stop in certain cases
to this process of absorption. For instance, many chiefs held
considerable numbers of Paihte or Vuite and Khawtlang in a species of
semi-slavery. These were captives or descendants of captives made in
war, and nearly all have availed themselves of the Pax Britannica to
return to their own people. Again, we found certain villages ruled over
by non-Lushei chiefs, who were living under the protection of powerful
Lushei chiefs. In the process of pacification these non-Lushei chiefs
regained their independence and have gathered round them many of their
clansmen, who formerly were scattered among the Lushei villages, and
who, if we may judge by what has undoubtedly happened in other cases,
would in a short time have become completely absorbed. Inquiries
lasting over many years have convinced me that these clans are little
more than enlarged families. In most cases the dialects of the minor
clans have been entirely forgotten, and the only differences remaining
are the manner of performing the &ldquo;sakhua&rdquo; or domestic
sacrifice, the position occupied by the corpse at the funeral feast,
and such other minor points. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A stranger might live for a long time in a Lushai
village without knowing that such divisions existed. Every clan is
further subdivided into families and branches. Thus the Lushei clan has
several families. One of these is the Thangur, and the Thangur family
has six branches&mdash;Rokum, Z&#257;deng, Rivung, Thangluah, Pallian,
and Sailo&mdash;but none of these branches has any further
sub-division, though the descendants of certain powerful chiefs are
sometimes collectively spoken of by their ancestor&rsquo;s name,
showing how these clan, family, and branch names have arisen.</p>
<p class="par">During the census of 1901 an unsuccessful attempt was
made to get a complete list of the clan families and branches. The
causes of the failure were the ignorance of the people themselves as to
what clan or family they belonged to and the tendency to claim to be
true Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">Everyone knew the name of the branch to which he
belonged, and as a rule the family name would be correctly given, but
in many cases the clan name was altogether omitted, or Lushei was
entered against families which had no real claim to that
distinction.</p>
<p class="par">An old Lushai once asked me why I was troubling myself
about family and branch names, and on my explaining that I hoped to
make a complete list of them he muttered, &ldquo;Can you count the
grains in that basket of rice?&rdquo; and turned from me to the
zu-pot.</p>
<p class="par">As a sample of the constitution of a clan I give in the
Appendix a list of all the families and branches of the Lushei
clan.</p>
<p class="par">My enquiries lead me to believe that practically all the
clan and a great many of the family and branch names are eponyms. In
some cases the name of a village site has been given to its
inhabitants, first probably by outsiders and eventually adopted by the
people themselves, but even in these cases as often as not enquiry will
show that the village site was first named after some famous chief who
lived there.</p>
<p class="par">Before the Thangur chiefs had risen to their present
predominant position there were many consanguineous communities
scattered over the hills, living under headmen of their own and each
using a dialect of its own. Some of these communities <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>appear
to have had separate corporate existence for long periods and in
consequence to have been sub-divided into many families and branches,
while others were quickly absorbed by the Thangur and consequently have
few sub-divisions.</p>
<p class="par">I have been accused of deriving &ldquo;Lushei&rdquo;
from <span class="corr" id="xd24e1581" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>lu,&rdquo; head, and
&ldquo;shei,&rdquo; long. If in the salad days of my sojourn among
these folks I was ever guilty of this folly, I hereby publicly
repudiate it. There is no doubt that Lushei, in common with the other
clan names, is an eponym.</p>
<p class="par">A versatile and imaginative writer has recently derived
&ldquo;Sailo,&rdquo; the name of the branch of the Lushai clan to which
the present chiefs belong, from &ldquo;sai&rdquo; elephant, and
&ldquo;lo,&rdquo; a jhum, alleging that because the elephant is the
biggest animal, therefore &ldquo;Sailo&rdquo; means the biggest jhum
and that the name refers to the excellence of the jhum land between
Burkhal and the source of the Kornaphuli river, where he says the
Sailos formerly lived. There are some objections to this theory; to
begin with, the Lushais never use &ldquo;sai&rdquo; as a prefix meaning
greatness, and secondly half the area mentioned was never inhabited by
Sailo chiefs, and thirdly only a small and little considered branch of
the great Sailo family ever entered this land of fatness and not till
long after the family name had been generally accepted; further the
name of the common ancestor of all the Sailo chiefs is known to have
been Sailova, which is a common name still in the family.</p>

organisation of the Lushais.</span> Among the Lushais, each village is
a separate State, ruled over by its own &ldquo;l&#257;l&rdquo; or
chief. Each son of a chief, as he attained a marriageable age, was
provided with a wife at his father&rsquo;s expense, and given a certain
number of households from his father&rsquo;s village and sent forth to
a village of his own. Henceforth he ruled as an independent chief, and
his success or failure depended on his own talents for ruling. He paid
no tribute to his father, but was expected to help him in his quarrels
with neighbouring chiefs; but when fathers lived long it was not
unusual to find their sons disowning even this amount of subordination.
The youngest son remained in his father&rsquo;s village and succeeded
not only to the village, but also to all the property.</p>
<p class="par">Our rule has tended to increase the independence of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>young chiefs; for in former days, when might was
right, it behoved a son to follow the advice of his father, or the
latter&rsquo;s help might not be forthcoming when danger
threatened.</p>
<p class="par">The chief was, in theory at least, a despot; but the
nomadic instinct of the people is so strong that any chief whose rule
was unduly harsh soon found his subjects leaving him, and he was
therefore constrained to govern according to custom.</p>
<p class="par">To assist him each chief appoints one or more elderly
men, known as &ldquo;upa.&rdquo; These form a sort of council which
discusses all matters connected with the village, and decides all
disputes between people of the village, for which they receive fees
termed &ldquo;sal&#257;m&rdquo; from the party who loses the case.
These fees are their only remuneration. The chief presides over this
council, which is generally held of an evening in the chief&rsquo;s
house, while the zu horn circulates briskly. The chief receives a
portion of each fine levied, a practice found to prevent undue
leniency.</p>
<p class="par">Besides the upas the chief appoints the following
village officials&mdash;&ldquo;r&#257;mhual&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tlangau.&rdquo; The former, of whom there may be several, are
advisers as to where the jhums shall be cut, and are allowed first
choice of land for the purpose, but have to give the chief five to
seven baskets of paddy instead of two, which is the portion due from
other subjects.</p>
<p class="par">The tlangau is the crier, whose high-pitched voice is
heard after dark, when every good householder is at home, proclaiming
the chief&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p class="par">He also arranges how the work of the village is to be
divided, who are to go and make a road, who are to repair the zawlbuk,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="par">In return for his labours he receives a small basket of
rice from each house in the village.</p>
<p class="par">Besides the r&#257;mhual and the tlangau, no village is
complete without at least one &ldquo;thirdeng,&rdquo; or blacksmith,
and a &ldquo;puithiam,&rdquo; or sorcerer. The former receives one
basket of rice from each householder whose tools he repairs; the latter
receives the same amount from each householder for whom he performs the
sacrifices connected with his cultivation.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The chief receives one hind leg of every wild animal
shot by any of his men, and when the killing of elephants was allowed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>he took one of the tusks if his villagers were
lucky enough to slay one of those animals.</p>
<p class="par">The villagers build the house of their ruler, and
formerly they also cut his jhum, but I regret to say that nowadays they
have ceased doing so, and this is an unsatisfactory sign of how,
without any desire on our part to do so, our rule has weakened the
authority of the chiefs.</p>
<p class="par">The chief held rather an anomalous position. Nominally
he was a despot&mdash;I am speaking now of the state of things which
existed prior to our occupation of the Hills&mdash;but in reality his
power was very much circumscribed, and his subjects could so easily
transfer their allegiance to some rival chief, who would probably be
willing, for a consideration, to champion the cause of his last
recruit, that every ruler had to use tact as well as force. In fact the
amount of power he wielded depended almost entirely on the personal
influence of the chief. A strong ruler, who governed mainly according
to custom, could do almost anything he liked without losing his
followers, but a weak man who tried petty tyrannies soon found himself
a king without any subjects.</p>
<p class="par">The chiefs naturally tried their best to stop people
leaving their villages, and it was customary to confiscate the paddy of
any person who left the village without permission, but leave was
seldom refused if the emigrant intended moving to the village of a
friendly chief; and if the fugitive took refuge with a more powerful
ruler it was extremely likely that a demand for the prompt surrender of
all his property would be made with such a show of force that it could
not be ignored.</p>
<p class="par">I add here two extracts from Colonel Lewin&rsquo;s book,
&ldquo;The Hill Tracts of Chittagong and the Dwellers Therein,&rdquo;
page 100.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The village system among the Kookis, <i>i.e.</i>
(Lushais) is best described as a series of petty states, each under a
Dictator or President. To illustrate the position of the chief or
President I may mention that in 1866, when on a visit to the village of
one of the leading chiefs among the Looshai, I was standing talking
with him in the path that ran through the village. While we were thus
standing a drunken Looshai came stumbling along, and finding us
somewhat in the way, he seized the chief by the neck and shoved him off
the path, asking why he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>stopped the road. On my asking the
chief for an explanation of such disrespect being permitted, he
replied, &lsquo;On the war-path or in the council I am chief, and my
words are obeyed; behaviour like that would be punished by death. Here,
in the village, that drunkard is my fellow and equal.&rsquo; In like
manner any presents given to the chief are common property. His people
walk off with them, saying: &lsquo;He is a big man, and will get lots
more given to him. Who will give to us if he does not?&rsquo; On the
other hand, all that is in his village belongs to the chief; he can and
does call upon people to furnish him with everything that he
requires.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To collect his people, or in fact to authenticate
any order, the chief&rsquo;s spear, which is usually carved and
ornamented, is sent by a messenger from village to village. Should the
message be a hostile one, the messenger carries a fighting dao, to
which a piece of red cloth is attached. Another method is by the
&lsquo;phuroi,&rsquo; which is a species of wand made out of strips of
peeled bamboo, about eight inches long, in this shape (&dagger;). If
the tips of the cross pieces be broken, a demand for blackmail is
indicated, a rupee to be levied for each break. If the end of one of
the cross pieces is charred, it implies urgency, and that the people
are to come even by torch light. If a capsicum be fixed on to the
&lsquo;phuroi,&rsquo; it signifies that disobedience to the order will
meet with punishment as severe as the capsicum is hot. If the cross
piece is of cane, it means that disobedience will entail corporal
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>The &ldquo;Boi&rdquo; Custom.</i>&mdash;Among the
Thados and Chins real slavery used to exist, and men and women were
sold like cattle. Among the Lushais this has never been the case, but
there is a class known as &ldquo;boi&rdquo; who have been miscalled
slaves by those ignorant of their real condition.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Lushais no one but a chief can have boi, who
are divided into the following classes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e1641" title=
"Source: (1)">(i.)</span> Inpuichhung (Inpui = big house, chhung =
within), Lalchhung, or Chhungte&mdash;<i>viz.</i> those who live in the
big house or chief&rsquo;s house. (ii.) chemshen boi (chem = dao, shen
= red); (iii.) tuklut boi (tuk = promise, lut = to enter). The first
class consist of all those who have been driven by want of food to take
refuge in the chief&rsquo;s house. Widows, orphans, and others
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>who are unable to support themselves, and have no
relatives willing to do so, form the bulk of this class of
&ldquo;boi,&rdquo; but it is not unusual, if a young widow remarries,
for her second husband to insist on his predecessor&rsquo;s children
being put into the chief&rsquo;s house, unless any of their
father&rsquo;s relatives will take them. The inpuichhung are looked on
as part of the chief&rsquo;s household, and do all the chief&rsquo;s
work in return for their food and shelter. The young men cut and
cultivate the chief&rsquo;s jhum and attend to his fish traps. The
women and girls fetch up wood and water, clean the daily supply of
rice, make cloths, and weed the jhum, and look after the chief&rsquo;s
children. In return the boi get good food and live in the chief&rsquo;s
house, and often wear his ornaments and use his guns and weapons. They
have to do very little more work than they would have to do if they
were independent, and, on the other hand, they are free of all anxiety
as to the morrow.</p>
<p class="par">As all the chiefs are of the same family, a boi is at
liberty to move from one chief&rsquo;s house to another. If a chief or
his wife treats a boi very badly, the injured one goes off and seeks
for a new master, and, as a large number of boi is considered to
increase a chief&rsquo;s importance, every chief is willing to receive
him, and therefore boi are generally well treated. In former days
powerful chiefs like Sukpuilala and Vutaia only allowed their boi to go
to one of their own relations, but even then a boi very often would
manage to find an asylum with some equally powerful chief.</p>
<p class="par">When a person has once entered the chief&rsquo;s house,
he or she can only purchase freedom by paying one mithan or its
equivalent in cash or goods. The fact that a boi can ever do this shows
that he is allowed to acquire property. When a male boi reaches a
marriageable age, the chief generally buys him a wife, and he lives
with her for three years in the chief&rsquo;s house: should he marry a
female boi, the couple have to live six years in the chief&rsquo;s
house. After this period, he sets up a house of his own and is known as
&ldquo;inhrang (in = house, hrang = separate) boi,&rdquo; and works for
himself, but is still in some respects a boi. If he kills any animal he
has to give a hind leg to the chief, and failure to do so renders him
liable to a fine of one mithan or its equivalent. If the chief is in
want of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>rice he can call on his boi to help him if they
have any surplus, and if a boi is in want he can look to the chief for
assistance.</p>
<p class="par">Regarding the children of such a boi, customs differ
somewhat. Some chiefs have made it the rule that only the youngest son,
who inherits his father&rsquo;s property, is a boi, the remainder of
the sons and all the girls being entirely free. Others insist that all
the children are boi, and that the chief is entitled to the marriage
prices of the daughters. They give, as a reason for this, that the
chief has paid for the boi&rsquo;s wife and so is entitled to consider
the children as boi. In either case the children are inhrang boi.</p>
<p class="par">A female boi is allowed to marry, and the chief receives
the marriage price, and when this has been paid in full he has no
further claim on the woman or her children during her husband&rsquo;s
lifetime, but should she be left a widow, she is sometimes forced to
re-enter the chief&rsquo;s house; but as a rule, if she behaves
decently, she is allowed to remain on in her husband&rsquo;s house, and
manage his property on behalf of his children, who are never considered
boi. Should she re-marry, the chief will again receive whatever sum is
paid as her marriage price.</p>
<p class="par">It will be seen that the inpuichhung are by no means
badly off, and the custom seems in every way suited to the
circumstances of the case. Many a clever young man rises from being a
boi to being the chief&rsquo;s most trusted adviser, and it is by no
means unusual for a chief to take a favourite boi into his own family
by the ceremony called &ldquo;Saphun&rdquo; (see under Adoption, page
54).</p>
<p class="par">(<i>ii.</i>) <i>Chemsen Boi (Red Dao
Boi).</i>&mdash;These are criminals who, to escape from the
consequences of their ill deeds, take refuge in the chief&rsquo;s
house. Murderers closely pursued by the avengers of blood rushed into
the chief&rsquo;s presence and saved their lives at the expense of
their own or their children&rsquo;s freedom. Debtors unable to pay
their creditors sought the chief&rsquo;s protection, and he released
them from their debts on condition that they and their children became
boi. Thieves and other vagabonds avoided punishment by becoming the
chief&rsquo;s boi. Civil disputes were unblushingly decided in favour
of the party who volunteered to become the chief&rsquo;s boi. It is
evident that the custom in these cases has grown up by degrees from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>chief&rsquo;s granting sanctuary to those who,
having committed serious crimes, were in danger of being killed by
those they had injured or their relatives.</p>
<p class="par">Chemsen boi do not live in the chief&rsquo;s house or
work for him. Their position is similar to that of an inhrang boi, but
all their children are considered boi to the same extent as their
parents. The chiefs generally take the marriage price of the daughters
of such Boi.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>iii<span class="corr" id="xd24e1678" title=
"Not in source">.</span></i>) <i>Tuklut (Enter by Promising)
Boi.</i>&mdash;These are persons who during war have deserted the
losing side and joined the victors by promising that they and their
descendants will be boi. A tuklut boi can purchase his freedom for a
mithan, and if there are three or four persons in one household one
mithan will release them all. As a rule the daughters of tuklut boi are
not considered boi. A tuklut boi does not live in the chief&rsquo;s
house, and is in most respects in the same position as an inhrang
boi.</p>
<p class="par">Chemshen boi have not been recognised by our officers,
and whenever one has claimed protection he has been released. The
tuklut boi have also not been formally recognised, but their duties
weigh so lightly on them that they <span class="corr" id="xd24e1686"
title="Source: seldon">seldom</span> claim their release, and in their
case, as in that of the &ldquo;s&#257;l,&rdquo; the class, receiving no
fresh recruits, will soon cease to exist. As regards the inpuichhung
boi, the custom seems well suited to the people and provides for the
maintenance of the poor, old, and destitute, and it would be extremely
unwise to attempt to alter it.</p>
<p class="par">When we first visited Kairuma in 1891, we found some 80
houses of Thado, Biate, and other clans living in his village (in a
species of serfdom) very much on the footing of the tuklut boi, only
that Kairuma received a mithan out of the marriage price of each of the
daughters as well as the other dues. These people were remnants of
conquered clans and were not allowed to leave the village. I was
assured that, if any of them tried to run away, a party of young men
would be at once sent off to kill or bring back the fugitives. When
Kairuma&rsquo;s village was burnt, owing to its continued contumacious
behaviour, all these people made their escape to the villages of their
own clans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par"><i>S&#257;l.</i>&mdash;Persons captured in raids are
called &ldquo;s&#257;l&rdquo;; their position is quite different from
that of any of the classes of boi. They are the personal property of
their captors, and I am told that when guns first made their appearance
in the hills the western tribes used to exchange their s&#257;l with
the eastern tribes for guns, one strong s&#257;l being worth two guns.
As a rule only children and marriageable women were taken captive, and
the latter were disposed of in marriage, the lucky captor acting <i>in
loco parentis</i> and taking the marriage price. The children grew up
in the captor&rsquo;s house as his children, and as a rule were so well
treated that they seldom wished to return to their former homes.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.3">3.
Marriage.</span> The Lushais have wide views as to matrimony. A young
man is not hampered in his choice by any table of prohibited degrees,
nor is his choice confined to any particular family or clan; in fact,
he can practically marry any woman he chooses except his sister or his
mother. There is, however, a certain amount of prejudice against first
cousins on the father&rsquo;s side marrying, but the reason generally
given for this is that when a girl&rsquo;s parents have to consider the
question of her marriage they naturally try to dispose of her outside
the family, in order that her price may increase the wealth of the
family, not merely transfer it from one brother to another. I have,
however, been told that girls object to marrying their
&ldquo;brothers.&rdquo; Among the chiefs the desire to marry another
chief&rsquo;s daughter limits the young man&rsquo;s choice, and
marriage among first cousins is more frequent than among commoners.
Marriage among nearly all the other clans dealt with in this monograph
is endogamous as regards the clan, but exogamous as regards the family.
When we consider the composition of the following of the Thangur
chiefs, we see at once the cause of this difference, for any
restrictions on intermarriage would have interfered with that fusion of
clans which was so necessary for the establishment of their power.</p>
<p class="par">Regarding the number of his wives also the Lushai has
great latitude; in fact, it is simply a matter of money. Experience has
taught them that two wives in one house is not conducive to peace, and
consequently polygamy is almost entirely confined to the chiefs, for
few others can afford to keep up two establishments. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>Marriage
is purely a civil contract, although, as is described in <a href=
"#ch1.4.7">Chapter IV, para. 7</a>, a pseudo-religious ceremony is
performed.</p>
<p class="par">Among Lushais the following sums constitute the price
which has to be paid for a wife:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">(<i>i.</i>) <i>Manpui (Principal Price).</i>&mdash;This
is paid to the bride&rsquo;s nearest male relative on the
father&rsquo;s side. In case the bride&rsquo;s father is dead and she
has brothers these divide the manpui, but if any one of them has
contributed more than the others to the girl&rsquo;s support, or has
provided her &ldquo;thuam&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, her
trousseau&mdash;he receives a larger share of the manpui than the
others.</p>
<p class="par">The manpui is always reckoned in mithan, and varies
according to the family of the bride. Thus a Thangur maiden is valued
at ten mithan, while less aristocratic girls are worth less, the lowest
price being three. A custom seems springing up of counting the manpui
in &ldquo;tlai&rdquo; = Rs. 20/-. If the bride&rsquo;s
&ldquo;thuam,&rdquo; or trousseau, is a good one a sum of Rs. 20/-,
called &ldquo;tlai,&rdquo; is added to the manpui, but should the woman
die without issue, this sum will not be paid, as the thuam will return
to her father&rsquo;s family. If she has children these inherit the
thuam, and therefore in such cases the tlai must be paid. The thuam
consists of necklaces, earrings, and superior cloths, not articles for
everyday use.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>ii.</i>) <i>Pushum.</i>&mdash;The perquisite of the
nearest male relative on the mother&rsquo;s side or of a person
specially chosen as the bride&rsquo;s &ldquo;pu&rdquo; or protector. It
varies between Rs. 4/-, and Rs. 10/- but in the case of a chief&rsquo;s
daughter it is a mithan.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>iii.</i>) <i>P&#257;l&#257;l.</i>&mdash;The bride or
her relations select some trusted friend, who may be of any family,
whom they appoint her &ldquo;p&#257;l&#257;l,&rdquo; or trustee, and he
is expected to look after her interests throughout her whole married
life. His fee varies in accordance with the pushum.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>iv.</i>) <i>Niman (Aunt&rsquo;s Price).</i>&mdash;A
sum equal to the pushum which has to be paid to the bride&rsquo;s aunt
on her father&rsquo;s side. If there are several aunts the eldest takes
the &ldquo;niman&rdquo; of the eldest niece and the second aunt that of
the second niece and so on. It is possible for a niece to refuse to
allow her aunt to take the niman and to select another person of her
own family. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">(<i>v.</i>) <i>Thian.</i>&mdash;The &ldquo;thian,&rdquo;
or friend, is a female p&#257;l&#257;l, but she only receives a small
sum from Rs. 10/- downwards.</p>
<p class="par">(<i>vi.</i>) <i>Nau Puan Puak Man (Price of Carrying the
Younger Sister in her Cloth).</i>&mdash;Each sister receives this from
the husband of her next younger sister. Among Sailo it varies from Rs.
20/- to Rs. 40/-; in other families it is only Rs. 3/- or Rs. 4/-. In
the case of the eldest sister it is taken by some near female
relative.</p>
<p class="par">These sums are never paid down at once; in fact, they
are allowed to remain unpaid for many years, but, as a rule, in each
family it is the custom to pay a certain amount of the manpui before
the marriage; this is called &ldquo;sum hm&#257; hruai,&rdquo;
&ldquo;price before taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Divorce.</i>&mdash;The bonds of matrimony are
extremely loose and are very easily slipped off. If a couple disagree
they simply separate. The woman returns to her parents and the man
renounces all claim to any portion of her price which he may have paid,
unless the woman agrees to its being partially returned. If the man
turns the woman out for no fault he must pay up her full price, if he
has not already done so. If a woman commits adultery or leaves her
husband against his will, however unfaithful he may have been, the
whole of her price has to be refunded.</p>
<p class="par">If a pair who have separated by mutual consent wish to
make it up they can do so. If the overtures are made by the man he is
expected to pay the woman a small sum up to Rs. 20/-<span class="corr"
id="xd24e1776" title="Not in source">.</span> If, however, the woman
makes the advances the man has nothing to pay.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Widow Re-marriage.</i>&mdash;There is no objection to
a widow remarrying. If a woman has a son and there is any property, it
is proper for her to remain unmarried and look after her son and his
interests; should she, however, wish to remarry there is nothing to
prevent her, but her late husband&rsquo;s relatives will take charge of
the children and all the property. Should a widow be left with
daughters only, it rests with her husband&rsquo;s nearest male
relatives whether she shall continue to live separately or shall enter
his house. It is not unusual in such cases for the widow to be allowed
to bring up her daughters, utilising, with the heir&rsquo;s approval,
whatever property has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>been left, but the marriage prices of the
girls will be taken by their father&rsquo;s heir. In olden times a
widow had to remain unwashed and with her hair uncombed for a whole
year from the death of her husband, but the period has been reduced to
three months, out of pity for the women, and after that time remarriage
is allowed. A widower who remarries before three months has passed
since his wife&rsquo;s death used to be fined, but this excellent
custom has dropped out of use. Should a woman elect to live in her late
husband&rsquo;s house and bring up his children, she is considered as
still married to him, and should she be detected in an intrigue her
relatives will have to refund her marriage price just as if her husband
were alive.</p>

<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.4">4. Female
chastity.</span> The unmarried girls are not very strictly looked
after, and, if they conduct their intrigues with a fair amount of
secrecy, nothing is said. As has been described in <a href=
"#ch1.3.3">Chapter II, 3</a>, there is a sleeping place on each side of
the hearth, that furthest from the door&mdash;kumpui&mdash;being
reserved for the parents, the other&mdash;kumai&mdash;being for the
girls and young children. Sometimes, however, if the family is large,
one of the girls sleeps with her parents. If a young man is found on
the kumai nothing is said to him; if, however, he trespasses on the
kumpui he is fined. In some villages if he even crosses the centre of
the hearth he is fined. The fine varies in different villages, but it
is about Rs. 10/-. If a girl becomes pregnant, the man responsible is
at once surrounded by her relatives, who demand a mithan as the price
of his indiscretion. This is called &ldquo;sawn man,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
price of the bastard.&rdquo; This has to be paid even in the case of
the child being born dead and in cases of premature births where the
legs and arms are complete.</p>
<p class="par">When the father has paid the sawn man he can claim the
child as soon as it is old enough to leave its mother.</p>
<p class="par">In cases in which the girl has been prodigal of her
favours, no sawn man can be demanded.</p>
<p class="par">In case a man should have a second illegitimate child by
the same woman, he is not expected to pay more than Rs. 10/- and often
nothing at all. For a third child he would, however, have to pay a
mithan. In case when asked to pay sawn man, the man at once expresses
his desire to marry the girl, he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>not have to pay the fine
in addition to the usual marriage price. If, however, he delays in
marrying her, he must pay both. In this matter, however, custom varies
considerably in different villages.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.5">5.
Inheritance.</span> The general rule is for the youngest son to
inherit, but occasionally the eldest also claims a share. With chiefs
it is usual for each son, as he comes to a marriageable age, to be
given a certain number of households and allowed to set up a village of
his own, but the youngest generally remains with his father, and
inherits his village and his property.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Adoption.</i>&mdash;Persons of property who have no
son sometimes adopt a near relative, but there is no special ceremony;
it is a purely private arrangement. The custom known as
&ldquo;S&#257;-phun,&rdquo; is in some respects akin to adoption.
Should a chief have a very favourite boi, he sometimes grants him
admission into his own clan. The &ldquo;puitiam&rdquo; being called, a
fowl or a pig is sacrificed, after the appropriate prayer has been
said, and a few of the hairs or feathers are tied round the man&rsquo;s
neck, and he is henceforth considered to belong to the <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e1817" title="Source: chief s">chief&rsquo;s</span>
clan. Anyone can thus admit another to his clan, but in practice it is
seldom done, except by chiefs. I think the sacrifice is made with a
view to propitiate the Sakhua of the clan which the man is
abandoning.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.6">6. Offences
regarding property.</span> Certain articles are said &ldquo;man a
nei,&rdquo; &ldquo;to have a price,&rdquo; and the theft of any of them
is punished by a fine of one mithan, quite irrespective of the actual
value of the article stolen. These are&mdash;rice cleaned or unhusked,
cloths, guns, brass pots, domestic animals, and wild animals, or birds
which have been killed or trapped. The theft of other articles is
punished by fines of from Rs. 1/- to Rs. 5/-, which are taken by the
chief and his upa, and termed &ldquo;sal&#257;m.&rdquo; Restitution of
the articles stolen is always insisted on.</p>
<p class="par">To steal or even to retain a hoe or axe found on the
road is most unlucky, and is supposed to be followed by the death of
the finder&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.7">7. Offences
connected with the body.</span> The punishment in these cases rested
originally with the aggrieved party or his relatives, who were allowed
to exact summary vengeance. Thus a husband was at liberty to kill an
unfaithful wife and her paramour, but if he did not take <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>refuge
in the chief&rsquo;s house, becoming a chemsen boi, the families of the
victims were also entitled to kill him whenever they got an
opportunity. Very shortly after our occupation of the Lushai Hills, two
lads deliberately cut down a man who, they were told, had murdered
their father many years before. The deed was done in broad daylight, in
the middle of the village, and apparently attracted but little
attention. The boys both entered the chief&rsquo;s house, and I should
never have heard of the occurrence had they not applied to be released
from service to the chief.</p>
<p class="par">To cut off the ears or nose of the paramour was a
favourite way for a husband to avenge himself, and he did not always
wait to be sure that there was anything to avenge. A man of
Lianphunga&rsquo;s village passed the night in Tlungbuta&rsquo;s
village, and, having been very hospitably treated by a friend, mistook
the house of a very jealous husband for that in which he was to sleep,
and was promptly ejected and deprived of his ears. Lianphunga, being a
more powerful chief than Tlungbuta, exacted ten mithan as compensation
for the injury done to his man, who, however, received absolutely
nothing. The chief kept eight of the animals and killed two to feast
the village, but the unfortunate victim was too ill even to share in
the feast.</p>
<p class="par">Rape or sodomy were punished in the same way, but the
latter, if committed with the consent of the pathicus or with an
animal, was not considered a crime, and there is no doubt that the
class of men known as Tuai, who dressed as women and did women&rsquo;s
work, indulged habitually in this disgusting vice. Fortunately the
class, never very large, has almost died out, but I fear the vice is
far from extinct.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.8">8. Decisions of
disputes.</span> The chief of each village, assisted by his upa, was
the one and only court of justice in the village, and from their
decisions there was no appeal, but nevertheless an unsuccessful
litigant found a way of getting his case reheard. If the matter in
dispute were of sufficient value to make half of it worth a great
chief&rsquo;s acceptance, the would-be appellant could generally find
some powerful chief who would accept him as a subject and take up his
quarrel on those terms. The custom of settling disputes by ordeal or by
oaths, which is so common among the Naga tribes, is almost unknown to
the Lushais. During the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>fourteen years I was among them I
have only twice heard a party to a case offer to accept the
other&rsquo;s oath.</p>
<p class="par">In ordinary cases, a man wishing to be believed will
take an oath holding a tiger&rsquo;s tooth, saying, &ldquo;If I lie,
may a tiger eat me as I now gnaw this tooth&rdquo;&mdash;suiting the
action to the word.</p>
<p class="par">An oath of friendship between chiefs is a serious
matter. A mithan is tied up to a post and the parties to the oath,
grasping a spear with their right hands, stab it behind the shoulder
with sufficient force to draw blood, repeating a formula to the effect
that until the rivers run backwards into the earth again they will be
friends. The animal is then killed and a little of the blood is smeared
on the feet and forehead of the oath takers. To make this oath more
binding they both eat a small piece of the liver raw.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.3.9">9<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e1850" title="Not in source">.</span> War and
head-hunting.</span> The true Lushai method of making war was to raid
the enemy&rsquo;s villages and carry off as many captives and as much
loot as possible. In this they form a great contrast to the Chins,
whose plan of action was systematically to ambush the paths in the
enemy&rsquo;s country and kill as many passers-by as possible. The
Lushais consider this unsporting and say pathetically, &ldquo;How can
men live if for fear of ambushes no cultivation can be carried
on?&rdquo; The Chins were fully aware of the effectiveness of their
method of warfare and resorted to it whenever they wished to extend
their boundaries, piqueting the coveted piece of land so effectually
that it was soon abandoned to them.</p>
<p class="par">The essence of success in Lushai tactics was surprise,
and no disgrace attached to a party of warriors which, on finding the
enemy on the alert, quickly returned home without attempting any
attack.</p>
<p class="par">The wars between the different Lushai clans lasted
sometimes for several years, but were not very energetically
prosecuted. Thus in a war between the Thangluah and Sailo chiefs which
lasted from about 1833 to 1850, about six villages were destroyed on
each side, but, except on one occasion, but few lives were lost. The
exception was the massacre of Thaurang, a Sailo chief&rsquo;s village,
which is still spoken of with pride by the descendants of the
perpetrators. The people of Thaurang were celebrating a great feast,
and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>all the principal houses in the village zu was
being dispensed to all comers. There had been no hostilities of late,
and the guards gradually abandoned their posts and joined the groups
round the zu pots. With song and dance the night passed merrily, and by
two or three in the morning no one was in a fit state to notice that a
large number of strangers, whose drunkenness was only assumed, had
mingled with the crowd. Suddenly a gun-shot gave the signal, and,
drawing their dahs, the Thangluahs fell on their enemies, who, too
drunk to know friend from foe, were slaughtered without mercy. Having
burnt the village, the successful warriors returned dragging with them
many captives. The Sailo chiefs tried to play the same trick on the
Thangluah when some time later the latter were celebrating their
victory with a large feast, but their intelligence department was
inefficient and the attack was not delivered till some days after the
feast.</p>
<p class="par">At that time there were but few guns in the country, and
so little was the use of those they had understood that the wad on the
top of the bullet was often omitted, with the natural result that when
the time for firing came there was no ball in the gun, and hot were the
arguments as to the value of this new-fangled weapon. In those days
also they had not acquired the art of making stockades, which they
subsequently copied from the Chins, and consequently there was but
little chance of resistance if the surprise was successful, and the
shouts of the assailants were a signal for a general stampede on the
part of the whole population. The attack was always delivered just
before daylight, and, if successful, but little time was lost; as many
captives as could be caught were collected and loaded with as much loot
as they could carry without retarding the retreat, and the whole party
set off and seldom halted till they had travelled forty-eight hours. As
a rule only strong women and children who could keep up in the retreat
were taken, all other captives being killed on the spot, and should any
captive lag behind a spear thrust quickly ended her career, and her
head was taken on to form an ornament in the raiders&rsquo; village.
Occasionally a few young men were carried off to be killed during the
festivities which were held in honour of the success of the raid. If
the raiders&rsquo; chief had a son too young to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>accompany them, a captive was frequently reserved
for him to slaughter and thus prove his bravery.</p>
<p class="par">Having put what they considered a safe distance between
them and any possible pursuers, the party proceeded more leisurely,
sending on messengers to announce their success, whose arrival set the
village in a ferment, and everyone commenced preparations for the
ensuing feast. As the brave warriors were seen in the distance the
whole population rushed out to meet them with horns of zu for their
refreshment, beating drums and gongs, and shouting praises of their
bravery. The following is an accurate translation of an account given
me by a Lushai of the proceedings which followed the return of a
successful raiding party:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Formerly the Lushais raided the Tipperahs and
captured about ten and dragged them back to their village, and killed
them either in the street or just in front of their houses. Presently
they said, &lsquo;Let us dance.&rsquo; They danced before the heads of
the slain, and a crowd collected and watched. The heads were placed on
posts around the open space in the village, and those who had killed
men came out into the space in the centre of the village with their
guns and fighting dahs, wearing their &lsquo;chhawn&rsquo; head-dress,
and the girls came with beautiful plaits of red and black cotton thread
and tied them round the knots of the young men&rsquo;s hair. This is
called &lsquo;arkezen.&rsquo; Then the young men danced beautifully.
&lsquo;We are very magnificent,&rsquo; they said. In the middle of the
open space a platform had been built of bamboos like those in front of
the house. On this everyone collected any number of eggs, and those who
had killed their enemies and those who had felt no fear ate up the eggs
as fast as possible. This is called &lsquo;m&#257;lchawh.&rsquo; Very
tall &lsquo;thingsia&rsquo; and &lsquo;phulrua&rsquo; (kinds of bamboo)
are put up in front of each man&rsquo;s house and called
&lsquo;r&#257;lngul,&rsquo; and they hang to the end of the phulrua, by
a piece of cane called &lsquo;vawmhrui,&rsquo; a circle of pierced
pieces of wood; these are called &lsquo;hrangkhual.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In wars between Lushais it was considered wrong to kill
chiefs. This, of course, was due to the chiefs being all of the same
family.</p>
<p class="par">When starting on a raid each man provided himself with
cooked rice for several days. This was rammed down very tightly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>into pieces of bamboo, so that several days&rsquo;
food could be conveniently carried without fear of any being lost on
the road. Sections of bamboos were also employed as water bottles, the
bamboo being cut above one joint and below the next and a small hole
made just below the joint on one side, which could be easily plugged
with a roll of leaves; for sake of lightness the bamboo would be
whittled down as much as could be safely done. These raiding parties
travelled immense distances. About 1850, Vuta, whose village was then
at Hweltu, suddenly appeared at Pirovi&rsquo;s village on the Soldeng,
and, taking the people entirely by surprise, made many captives, among
whom were the chieftainess and her infant son. Many others were killed
and much loot rewarded the daring savages. The distance between the two
villages is about seventy miles in an air line and at least twice that
by the jungle paths. Although guns quickly became common in the Hills,
the style of warfare did not change. In the war between the Northern
and Southern Chiefs, which lasted from 1856 to 1859, each side only
made three successful raids, and the actual number killed in action
appears to have been very small. I once asked one of the chiefs who had
been very prominent in one of the later wars how many men he had killed
with his own hand, and, on my expressing surprise at his admitting that
he killed none, he na&iuml;vely remarked, &ldquo;You see, we chiefs
always go last, shouting &lsquo;Forward, forward!&rsquo; and by the
time I reached the village the people had always run away.&rdquo;
Though the Lushais were able to turn the Thados and other clans of
their own kindred out of their possessions, yet when they came in
contact with the Chins they were invariably defeated. In 1881 a large
force of Southern Lushais raided Bunkhua, a Chin village to the north
of the Tao hill. They burnt the village without much trouble, but the
Chins refused to acknowledge this as a defeat and kept up a hot fire on
their assailants, killing one of their bravest warriors. When the
Lushais set out on their return journey they found the whole country
up, and in a gorge they were greeted with a volley which laid forty of
them low, and the remainder fled in all directions, and, had it not
been for heavy rain, which washed away the bloodstains and made
tracking difficult, but few would have reached their homes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Although when fighting among themselves the ambushing of
cultivators and travellers was disapproved of, they resorted to it
freely when fighting us, but our casualties were not very great, as the
ambushers were so anxious about their own safety they generally fired
too soon. These ambushes were always arranged below the road, where the
ground fell away very sharply, and, having fired, the brave fellows
hurled themselves down the hill, ignoring all cuts and scratches in
their anxiety to escape.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Head-hunting.</i>&mdash;It used to be considered that
all inhabitants of these Hills were head-hunters. In fact, so great an
authority as Colonel Lewin derives the name &ldquo;Lushai&rdquo; from
&ldquo;lu,&rdquo; &ldquo;a head,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sha,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to cut.&rdquo; This, of course, is a mistake, as the name of the
clan is not Lushai, but Lushei, and though &ldquo;sha&rdquo; does mean
&ldquo;to cut,&rdquo; it does not mean &ldquo;to cut off,&rdquo; and
could not be used of cutting off a man&rsquo;s head; but that such a
mistake should have been possible shows how firmly rooted was the
belief that head-hunting was one of the peculiarities of the population
of these Hills. I believe that as far as the Lushais and their kindred
clans are concerned, head-hunting was not indulged in. By this I mean
that parties did not go out simply to get heads. Of course, a man who
had killed his man was thought more highly of than one who had not,
and, therefore, when a man did kill a person he brought the head home
to show that he was speaking the truth; but the raids were not made to
get heads, but for loot and slaves. The killing and taking of heads
were merely incidents in the raid, not the cause of it. I think that
the Chins or Pois are an exception to this, and, as far as I can
gather, the glory of bringing in a head was sufficient to send a young
man and his friends off on the raid.</p>
<p class="par">I have also made careful enquiries in all parts of the
Hills as to whether there is any truth in the commonly accepted theory
that on the death of a chief a party was at once sent off to kill
people in order that their heads might adorn his memorial and their
ghosts wait on his spirit in the other world, but I never heard
anything which lent any colour to the idea, and, as regards Lushais, I
believe it to be a pure invention; but it was undoubtedly a Thado
custom. If a single person is killed in a raid every person in the
attacking party is entitled to all the honours pertaining to a slayer
of a man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

<p class="par first"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.1">1. General
form of religious beliefs.</span> Practically all divisions of the
Lushai-Kuki family believe in a spirit called Pathian, who is supposed
to be the creator of everything and is a beneficent being, but has,
however, little concern with men.</p>
<p class="par">Far more important to the average man are the numerous
&ldquo;Huai&rdquo; or demons, who inhabit every stream, mountain, and
forest, and to whom every illness and misfortune is attributed. The
&ldquo;puithiam&rdquo; (sorcerer) is supposed to know what demon is
causing the trouble and what form of sacrifice will appease him, and a
Lushai&rsquo;s whole life is spent in propitiating these spirits.</p>
<p class="par">In addition to Pathian and the Huai there is a spirit
known as Khuavang, who is sometimes spoken of as identical with
Pathian, but is generally considered to be inferior to him, and more
concerned with human beings. Khuavang sometimes appears to people, and
his appearance is always followed by the illness of those who see him.
A Lushai will say, &ldquo;My Khuavang is bad,&rdquo; if things are
going wrong with him, and he will also tell you that you are his
Khuavang, meaning that his fate rests with you. I have also been told
that there are two spirits called Mivengtu, watchers of men. One of
these is a good spirit and guards people; the other is a bad spirit who
is always trying to sell men to the Huai. Similarly each person is said
to have two &ldquo;thlarao,&rdquo; or souls, one of which is wise,
while the other is foolish, and it is the struggles between these two
that make men so unreliable. If a man hits his foot against a stone, he
attributes it to a temporary victory of the foolish spirit.</p>
<p class="par">In addition to all these spirits, there is another. Each
clan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>has a special spirit presiding over its destinies.
The spirit is known as &ldquo;Sakhua,&rdquo; and all sacrifices to him
have to be performed by a puithiam of the clan, and only members of the
family can be present.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushais believe in a spirit world beyond the grave,
which is known as Mi-thi-khua&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, dead man&rsquo;s
village&mdash;but on the far side of Mi-thi-khua runs the Pial river,
beyond which lies Pial-ral, an abode of bliss. Access to this is not
obtained by a life of virtue while on earth, but the due performance of
sacrifices and the killing of men and certain animals and success in
the courts of Venus. The following account of the common belief was
written for me by a Lushai, who embellished his essay with a map. It
will be noticed that in the latter he has inserted the Kristian&rsquo;s
(Christian&rsquo;s) village and their heaven, the road to which is
under Isua (Jesus), while the roads to the Lushai&rsquo;s Mi-thi-khua
are watched by Seitana (Satan). This incorporation of the teaching of
the missionaries with the indigenous belief is not without interest,
showing a broad spirit of tolerance in the author, who, without
abandoning the faith of his forefathers, is ready to admit the truth of
Christianity and its suitability to those who profess it, and sees no
difficulty in providing in the unknown lands beyond the grave a special
country for each race, just as there is in the world he knows of.</p>

shoot at a young man who has enjoyed three virgins, nor at one who has
enjoyed seven different women, even if they were not virgins; but
women, whoever they may be, he always shoots at. They say that there is
a road between the Mi-thi-khua and the Rih lake. [This lake is on the

<p class="par">The Thangchhuah, mentioned above, are those who have
slain men and certain animals and have given a series of feasts to the
village, which will be found described in <a href="#ch1.4.9">para. 9 of

much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

admission to Pial-ral after death, can only be obtained by killing a
man and each of the following animals&mdash;elephant, bear, sambhur,
barking deer, wild boar, wild mithan&mdash;and by giving the feasts
enumerated below; but it is well also to have killed a species of snake
called &ldquo;rulngan,&rdquo; a bird called &ldquo;vahluk&rdquo; and a
species of eagle called &ldquo;mu-v&#257;n-l&#257;i&rdquo; (hawk in the
middle of the sky). A Lushai gave me the following account of the
journey of Thangchhuah to Pial-ral.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After death the dead man holds the horns of the
sambhur while sitting on its head, the rulngan will wind itself round
him and the horns, the mu-v&#257;n-l&#257;i will try to seize the
rulngan, but the Thangchhuah can drive them off. That is why they
always fly screaming so high in the sky. The v&#257;hluk shade him by
flying above him and also hide him from Pupawla, and thus the
Thangchhuah is carried to Pial-ral.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In Pial-ral food and drink are to be obtained without
labour, which to the Lushai appears the height of bliss.</p>
<p class="par">The omission of the tiger from the list of animals which
a Thangchhuah must have killed is curious, and I cannot explain it as
the Lushais have no superstitious objection to killing tigers and the
&ldquo;Ai&rdquo; of a tiger is a very special function, as will be seen
in <a href="#ch1.4.4">para. 4 of this chapter</a>.</p>
<p class="par">This ceremony called &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; is always
performed when a man or a wild animal has been killed. It is supposed
to give the performer&rsquo;s ghost power over the ghosts of the man or
animals killed. He is described as going to Pial-ral leading the ghost
of his enemy on a string like a dog. Every member of a hunting party in
which an elephant is killed or of a raiding party in which a man is
slain is entitled to say that he has killed an elephant or a man. This
simplifies admission to Pial-ral, and now that the killing of men and
elephants is prohibited by an unsympathetic Government, it is popularly
supposed that this qualification will not be insisted on.</p>
<p class="par">Many people profess to have seen Mi-thi-khua in their
dreams, but none claim to have seen Pial-ral. Should a person dream of
his parents and in his dream accept rice from their hands he will die
without fail in a very short time.</p>
<p class="par">I have been told that the spirits of the dead sometimes
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=

in the form of dew, and if this falls on a person the spirit is reborn
in his or her child.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.2">2. Ancestor
worship.</span> Though this can scarcely be said to be the religion of
the Lushais, yet they firmly believe that the spirits of the dead are
constantly present and need to be propitiated, and one of the principal
Thangchhuah feasts is in honour of the dead. This is described in
<a href="#ch1.4.9">para. 9 of this chapter</a>.</p>
<p class="par">At every feast or sacrifice a small portion of flesh,
rice, and a little zu is placed on a shelf under the eaves for the
spirits of the dead members of the family. This is called
&ldquo;rao-chhiak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A little of the first fruits of each crop is always
placed on the wall under the eaves, above the spot where the water
tubes are stacked, as an offering to the cultivator&rsquo;s parents.
This is called &ldquo;Mi-thi-chhiah,&rdquo; but there is another more
important Mi-thi-chhiah. It is supposed that the spirits of the
departed are very fond of coming to watch the Kut festivities (see
<a href="#ch1.4.9">para. 9 of this chapter</a>) and on such occasions
the spirit of a mother will enter her daughter&rsquo;s body and the
daughter then goes off into a trance. The Lusheis say, &ldquo;Mi-thi in
a thluk&rdquo; (The dead has taken her place). To cause the spirit to
depart and restore the girl to consciousness it is necessary to perform
the ceremony called Mi-thi-chhiah. Necklaces, earrings, cloths,
petticoats, rice, and zu are placed in a heap on the floor where the
corpse of the deceased was seated during the funeral feast. Then the
worst cloth and petticoat of the girl are burnt in the forge and she
forthwith returns to life. One reason given for the behaviour of the
spirit is that sufficient attention to the adornment of the corpse at
the funeral feast had not been paid. The spirit is supposed to be able
to brood over the slight put on its late tenement; hence the collection
of all sorts of cloths and ornaments on the spot where the corpse had
been seated.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.3">3. Worship of
natural forces and deities.</span> The Lushais do not worship the sun
or moon or any of the forces of nature, though when wishing to
emphasise a statement they frequently say, &ldquo;If what I say is not
true, may the sun and moon desert me.&rdquo; But they believe the
hills, streams, and trees are inhabited by various demons. These are
known as &ldquo;Huai,&rdquo; those inhabiting the water being called
&ldquo;Tui-huai,&rdquo; and those residing on land being known as
&ldquo;R&#257;m-huai.&rdquo; These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>spirits are uniformly bad, and
all the troubles and ills of life are attributed to them, and the
sacrifices described in the next part are supposed to appease them.</p>
<p class="par">The following account of the doings of one of these Huai
was given me by Suakhnuna, one of the most intelligent of the Lushei
chiefs:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A R&#257;m-huai named Chongpuithanga used to live
near the ford over the Sonai. He said he was the servant of the King of
the Huai and was always on the look out for men along the banks of the
river. He spoke through a girl called Ziki, who was often ill, and used
to go into trances. He demanded a pig and professed to have caused the
deaths of ten persons of the village.&rdquo; The following is another
story which the teller fully believed. &ldquo;About six years ago
Hminga, of L&#257;lbuta&rsquo;s village, was looking at a ngoi (fishing
weir) and saw some R&#257;m-huai. These wore the chawndawl (headdress
worn by slayers of men), and round these were strings of babies&rsquo;
skulls. On his return home he got very ill, and all his family kept on
asking him what was the matter, but when he was going to tell them the
R&#257;m-huai would seize him by the throat so that he could not tell
them. If he managed to say a few words he got a pain in the head. He
did not die, but recovered.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;A woman of
L&#257;lbuta&rsquo;s village went out of her house at night for
purposes of nature. Her name was Mang&#257;mi; she was enceinte. The
Huai of the Tuitlin precipice caught her, and forced out the immature
child and then carried her off down the rocks. The young men of the
village went to search for her and found her naked in the jungle at the
foot of the precipice, where the R&#257;m-huai had left her. She knew
nothing about it. She recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following story gives rather a different view of the
Huai:&mdash;&ldquo;A man called Dailova, who may be alive now, did not
know that it was time for him to perform his Sakhua sacrifice. He and
his son went down to fetch &lsquo;dhan&rsquo; from the jhum house, and
slept there among the straw; in the night the boy, feeling cold, went
into the jhum house and slept among the paddy, but Dailova covered
himself up in the straw and kept warm. Towards morning two Huais came
along, one of whom was called Lianthawnga, and the other,
R&#257;m-huai, called to him, &lsquo;Where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>are you
going to, Lianthawnga?&rsquo; and he replied &lsquo;I am going to
Lungzawl.&rsquo; Then Dailova, from under the straw, called out,
&lsquo;Where are you going to, Lianthawnga?&rsquo; Then the
R&#257;m-huai came into the straw and wrestled with Dailova. When they
had finished wrestling it was daylight, so they ate their rice and came
home, and R&#257;m-huai followed them and wrestled with Dailova.
Sometimes the R&#257;m-huai appears as a tiger and sometimes as a man.
Dailova kept on saying, &lsquo;I will wrestle again with him,&rsquo;
and at last he called out, &lsquo;I have conquered.&rsquo; Then the
R&#257;m-huai told him that his Sakhua sacrifice was overdue and he
performed it at once.&rdquo; In the last story the R&#257;m-huai is
represented in much the same aspect as Khu&#257;v&#257;ng has been
described to me by others, one of whom told me that once, returning
from a drinking bout at the chief&rsquo;s house, he had found a man of
huge stature sitting by his hearth, who after staring at him for a
moment or two disappeared. Another, who also had been at a feast, while
on his way home saw huge men with enormous heads passing through the
jungle. In both these cases the narrators assured me that they were
perfectly sober; in fact, one of them alleged as a reason for being
sure that the figure which he saw was Khu&#257;v&#257;ng was that, in
spite of having drunk a great deal, he did not feel intoxicated. In
each case the vision was followed by a severe illness.</p>
<p class="par">There is a lake called &ldquo;Dil,&rdquo; between the
southern border of the Lushai Hills and the Arracan hill tracts, which
was credited with being the abode of many savage Tui-huai. No hill man
would go within sight of the water, and when I first went there I had
great difficulty in getting men to accompany me. The story is that some
foreigner visited the place once and climbed into a tree overhanging
the water, whence he dropped his knife into the lake and sent one of
his men down to fetch it. The diver returned without the knife, but
with tales of wonderful beings beneath the water. The foreigner fired
his gun into the lake, whereupon numbers of Tui-huai emerged and chased
the whole party of intruders, catching and carrying off all except
their leader, who made good his escape.</p>
<p class="par">Every form of sickness is attributed to the influence of
some Huai or other, and all tales about Huais either begin or end,
&ldquo;There was much sickness in our village.&rdquo; At the time of an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>epidemic there is probably some hysterical girl,
such as Ziki appears to have been, whose mind has been imbued with
tales of Huais, who works herself up into a frenzy and believes herself
possessed of a devil. This theory receives confirmation from the facts
recorded in the <a href="#ch1.5">next chapter</a> regarding Khawhring.
Not every Huai is known by name, and the sacrifices about to be
described are offered to all Huais of a particular class.</p>
<p class="par"><i>L&#257;shi.</i>&mdash;Although the L&#257;shi are not
considered as demons or divinities, yet this seems an appropriate place
to deal with them. A Lushai describes them thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The
L&#257;shi folk are spirits which live in the Lur and T&#257;n
precipices. Formerly a Lushai young man went shooting alone. Beneath
the T&#257;n precipice a most beautiful L&#257;shi maiden was weaving,
and on seeing her the youth became love-sick and could not go away, so
he stayed and courted her all day, till it began to grow dark; then the
L&#257;shi maiden, wishing to go to her house, asked him to roll up her
weaving for her, but he would not. Then she said to him, &lsquo;What
animal would you most like to shoot?&rsquo; and on his saying an
elephant she at once caused him to kill one and he bore its head back
in triumph, while the L&#257;shi maiden and her mother rolled up the
cloth and disappeared into the precipice.&rdquo; My informant assured
me that had the young man rolled up the weaving he would never have
escaped. In another tale a L&#257;shi youth falls in love with the
daughter of a man called Lianlunga, to whom he appeared in a dream and
offered to place in his tobacco box the fur of many wild animals and to
enable him to shoot every animal the fur of which was in the box. In
return for this Lianlunga agreed to the match, and both he and his wife
were given the power of decoying wild animals. Lianlunga&rsquo;s wife
would pinch her pig&rsquo;s ear, and if it made no noise Lianlunga
would go out shooting and Chawntinleri, a younger sister of the
L&#257;shi son-in-law, would drive all the animals past him, and he
shot what he liked, for the L&#257;shi had tamed all the animals.
Lianlunga, however, came to a tragic end through trying to dispense
with the services of the L&#257;shi. He enticed a wild metna under his
house and then tried to spear it through the floor, but only wounded it
and the animal escaped. This offended the L&#257;shi, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>who
&ldquo;made the barb of an arrow come out of his heart so that he
died.&rdquo; The L&#257;shi seem to be only concerned with wild
animals, over whom they are believed to have complete control.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.4">4. Religious rites
and ceremonies.</span> In this part I propose only to deal with the
various sacrifices which play so important a part in a Lushai&rsquo;s
existence, but the festivals described in para. 9 are, to a certain
extent, religious ceremonies, and are performed with the idea of
pleasing the gods. Suakhnuna explained to me, when giving the
description of the Thangchhuah feasts, that Pathian resided in the sky
and that these feasts were supposed to please him. Similarly, the
carrying about of the effigies of their ancestors in the
&ldquo;mi-thi-rawp-lam&rdquo; is supposed to be acceptable to the
spirits of the departed. In these feasts I think we may safely trace
the rude beginnings of the magnificent pageants performed by the
Manipuris and called by them
&ldquo;Lai-harauba&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Pleasing the
god.&rdquo; Before describing the various sacrifices it is necessary to
explain some of the terms used.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Hrilh</i> closely approximates to the Naga
&ldquo;Genna.&rdquo; The meaning is that those to whom it applies must
do no work, except necessary household tasks, and must not leave a
prescribed area. The &ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; may apply to the whole village
or only to the household of the performer of the sacrifice, and the
area in which those under &ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; are allowed to move about
may be either their own house and garden, or the village limits.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Sherh.</i>&mdash;This term is used to describe the
portions of the animal sacrificed, which are reserved for the god or
Huai. These portions vary slightly in different sacrifices, but,
generally speaking, they are the extremities and some of the internal
organs, such as the heart, liver, or entrails. In every case the
extremities are included. I believe the Khasis offer these to the
&ldquo;thlen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2013src" href=
"#xd24e2013" name="xd24e2013src">1</a> I have found the Manipuri
iron-workers when about to work a new deposit, also offer the hair from
the end of the tail and from the fetlocks, and a little blood drawn
from the ear of the buffalo, to the local god. Having become Hindus,
they can no longer kill the animal as their forefathers did, but still
make this offering of the &ldquo;sherh.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sherh&rdquo; is
also used in the sense of tabu. Thus a house in which a sacrifice has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>been performed may be said to be
&ldquo;sherh,&rdquo; meaning that no one outside the household may
enter it. Portions of the animal killed are kept for certain periods,
during this time are &ldquo;sherh,&rdquo; and cannot be touched by
outsiders. A woman is &ldquo;sherh,&rdquo; for some days after her
confinement, and during that time must not go to the water supply.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Thiang-lo</i> is translated by the missionaries as
&ldquo;unlawful,&rdquo; but I think &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; more exactly
represents the meaning, which is that a certain act will be followed by
some misfortune to the doer.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2024src" href=
"#xd24e2024" name="xd24e2024src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">The sacrifices made by Lushais may be divided into eight
classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i>S&#257;khua.</i>&mdash;A sacrifice to the guardian spirit of
the clan or family.</li>
<li>2. <i>Kh&#257;l.</i>&mdash;These are sacrifices to Huai supposed to
frequent the village and houses.</li>
<li>3. <i>Daibawl.</i>&mdash;These are to propitiate the Huai in the
jungle, streams, and mountains.</li>
<li>4. Various sacrifices in case of sickness.</li>
<li>5. Sacrifices to cure barrenness in women.</li>
<li>6. <i>Nao-hri.</i>&mdash;These sacrifices should be performed once
in a lifetime in a particular order.</li>
<li>7. Sacrifices connected with hunting and killing animals.</li>
<li>8. Sacrifices connected with jhuming.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote"><b>1. S&#257;khua.</b></span>
From the chant given below a good idea is obtained of what the word
&ldquo;S&#257;khua&rdquo; means to the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">Each clan has a special chant or invocation, and though
in almost every case the animal sacrificed is a big sow, yet the method
and place of the sacrifice and the disposal of the &ldquo;sherh&rdquo;
vary in each clan, and uniformity in this respect is looked on as proof
positive that two families belong to the same clan.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Lushei clans the sacrifice must be performed
by a pui-thiam of the clan, and the pig is killed outside the house,
but is brought in to be cooked and eaten. The legs and ribs have to be
kept for three days above the rafters, and during this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>time
they are &ldquo;sherh,&rdquo; and if they are touched by anyone of
another family, someone of the household performing the sacrifice will
suffer in some way, unless another pig is quickly killed. The skull of
the animal is hung on the centre post inside the house. The sacrifice
is generally made about once in four years, unless the pui-thiam
advises the performance more frequently on account of sickness. The
following is the chant or invocation used by the pui-thiam at this
sacrifice<span class="corr" id="xd24e2073" title=

drawn out note. The refrain &ldquo;And accept, &amp;c.,&rdquo; is

<p class="par first">Bualchuam hill is the hill in which the first men
built their first village, Buhm&#257;m the hill on which the first
bird&rsquo;s nest was built by a crow. The other hills mentioned give a
clue to the village sites of the first Lushei chiefs. The omission of a
prayer to be preserved from the danger of gunshots shows that the chant
has remained unaltered in spite of the gun having superseded the dah
and the spear.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote"><b>2. Kh&#257;l.</b></span>
There are many sorts of Kh&#257;l. The following are some of the most
important.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Vok-te-Kh&#257;l.</i>&mdash;A small pig killed near
the head of the parents&rsquo; sleeping platform, flesh cooked inside
the house, and the skull hung over the sleeping place. The sherh
consisting of the heart and liver and fat, are kept for the night in a
pot with salt and rice and then thrown away. The day of the sacrifice
and the night following are &ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; for the household.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ar-Kh&#257;l.</i>&mdash;Similar to the Vok-te, but a
red cock is killed, and instead of the head, the long feathers from
above the tail, called &ldquo;fep&rdquo; by the Lushais, are strung on
a cane and hung <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>over the parents&rsquo; sleeping place. The sherh,
consisting of the head, feet, heart and liver, and wings, are placed in
a small basket and thrown away in the morning.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kel-Kh&#257;l.</i>&mdash;A goat is killed in a place
where the water tubes are kept; its flesh is cooked inside the house.
The sherh are hung on a cane in the front verandah. The hrilh lasts
three days, and during that time no intercourse must be held with
strangers, nor must any of the household enter the forge.</p>
<p class="par">These three sacrifices should always be performed soon
after marriage, but poor persons postpone them till ill-health shows
that the Huais will wait no longer. Dreams are also the means of
notifying when a Kh&#257;l should be performed. If a person dreams of a
beautiful stranger of the opposite sex who laughs constantly, then the
Vok-te-Kh&#257;l should be performed, and if the dream is repeated
often Ar-Kh&#257;l must follow or the dreamer will certainly get ill.
Should a tiger bite the dreamer, Kel-Kh&#257;l is most urgently needed,
and if not performed the dreamer will certainly die. Persons who dream
this dream are so frightened that they will not leave their houses
after dark, nor stir beyond the village during the day, for fear of a
tiger seizing them.</p>
<p class="par"><i>V&#257;n-chung-Kh&#257;l.</i>&mdash;A white cock is
killed on the hearth and the flesh cooked inside the house. The sherh
are placed in a winnowing basket on the top shelf over the hearth with
salt and a little rice taken from the pot before anyone has eaten. The
next morning it is thrown away. Hrilh only for one night.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kh&#257;l-chuang</i> or
<i>Mei-awr-lo</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Tail not worn&rdquo;&mdash;because it
is not obligatory for the performer to wear the tail on a string round
his neck as is is done in Kel-Kh&#257;l.</p>
<p class="par">A goat is killed as in Kel-Kh&#257;l and the sherh are
treated in the same way, but the flesh must not be cooked till the next
day, and it is &ldquo;thiang-lo&rdquo; to eat &ldquo;thei-hai&rdquo;
fruit. Though this sacrifice is so very similar to the Kel-Kh&#257;l,
yet it is considered more efficacious.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote"><b>3. Daibawl.</b></span> The
commonest of these is &ldquo;Tui-leh-r&#257;m&rdquo; (water and land).
This sacrifice has to be performed at the outskirts of the village. It
is to appease the demons inhabiting the woods and the streams.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A cock and hen are killed. Three bamboos are brought; of
these &ldquo;theibial&rdquo; are made, which are pieces of bamboo about
four inches long stuck into the ground. A small basket called
&ldquo;maich&#257;m&rdquo; is also made, and some small square mats
called &ldquo;lengleh&rdquo; made of a thin strip of bamboo bent round
and round itself and kept in position by lacings of black and red
threads. These are hung from small pieces of bamboo stuck into the
theibial. The fowls&rsquo; throats are cut and the blood allowed to
flow on the maich&#257;m and theibial. Then three small stones are
brought from the nearest stream and a shallow hole is dug at the place
of sacrifice and lined with a wild plantain leaf. In this some water is
poured and the stones and the sherh are placed in the water. The
fowls&rsquo; flesh may be cooked and eaten either on the spot or in the
house.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Bawl-pui.</i>&mdash;This is a very important
sacrifice, which is seldom performed and only after all others have
been tried. Two small clay figures are made, one to represent a man and
the other a woman. These are called &ldquo;r&#257;m-chawm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The female figure has a petticoat of
&ldquo;hnahtial&rdquo; (a plant which has tough leaves used for
wrapping up food to be taken on a journey), and is made to bite the
pig&rsquo;s liver.</p>
<p class="par">The male figure is provided with a pipe and a necklace
of the liver of the pig which is sacrificed. A small bamboo platform is
made, and on it is put a clay model of a gong and other household
utensils, and sometimes of mithan.</p>
<p class="par">The pig&rsquo;s throat is cut and the blood allowed to
flow over the platform, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="par">The pig&rsquo;s flesh is cooked on the spot. To take it
into the house is &ldquo;thianglo.&rdquo; Many persons come and eat it
with the puithiam. If the patient does not die during the performance
of the sacrifice or during the subsequent feast he will undoubtedly
recover.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote"><b>4. Various sacrifices in
case of sickness.</b></span> <i>K&#257;ngpuiz&#257;m.</i>&mdash;This is
a very important and efficacious sacrifice, and can only be performed
by a certain wise man of the Khawtlang or Vuite clans. It costs Rs.
40/- besides the cost of the animals killed and zu drunk. In front of
the house a sort of arbour is made of grass and boughs supported on
four sticks. All round this are hung little balls made of split cane
rolled up tight. This split cane is said to be much liked by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>the devils. All round the house strands of cane
are stretched, the ends being tied to the arbour. The devils are
supposed to be unable to pass these canes, so that the sorcerer has no
fear of the devils who are already inside the house being assisted by
recruits from the outside. Drinking of zu and reciting of charms goes
on during the day, and after dark the sorcerer and his assistants get
up on the roof of the sick man&rsquo;s house and commence marching up
and down reciting charms and ordering the devils to leave the man, and
offering them asylum in the bodies of a goat, pig, and dog which they
carry with them. After some shouting and firing of a gun the party sit
down on the roof over the front entrance of the house, and the sorcerer
commences a long incantation over each of the animals in turn, beating
them and stamping on them. Then some of the party come down and the
rest retire to the back of the house, and each of the animals is
brought in turn from the far end of the house, being made to walk on
its hind legs to the front, and then is thrown down on to the entrance
platform. Lastly a big bough is carried from the back of the house
along the roof and fixed in a hole through the roof over the entrance.
From this bough a cane is stretched to the arbour. Then all the rest of
the party come down, and after many incantations and much shouting the
animals are sacrificed and eaten by the sorcerer and his assistants,
the usual useless portions being hung up in the arbour for the devils,
who are supposed to have been driven either into the animal or along
the cane into the arbour.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ui-hring.</i>&mdash;A full-grown dog or bitch is
killed on the entrance platform and its flesh is cooked in front of the
house. Blood is put on the sick man&rsquo;s wrist, inside his elbow
joint, on his forehead, on his chest, at the back of the knee and
ankle. Sherh and head are hung up on a post.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Hring-ai-t&#257;n.</i>&mdash;Similar, but a different
charm is muttered and the heart is roasted and eaten. The house is
&ldquo;sherh&rdquo; for one day, leaves being hung in front of the door
to warn outsiders. One day&rsquo;s hrilh is observed.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Khuavang-hring.</i>&mdash;Puithiam decides what
animal shall be killed, and the sacrifice takes place on a platform
before the house, the flesh being cooked in the street. Sherh and head
are hung on a post in a small basket. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par"><i>Thlako (The Calling of the
Spirit).</i>&mdash;Sometimes a Lushai returning from a shooting
expedition experiences a sudden feeling of fear near the water supply,
and on reaching his house feels ill and out of sorts. He then realises
that he has lost one of his &ldquo;thlarau,&rdquo; or souls, in the
jungle. So he calls in the puithiam and requests him to call back the
wanderer. The puithiam then hangs the head of a hoe on to the shaft of
a spear and goes down to the water spring chanting a charm and calling
on the spirit to return. As he goes the iron hoe head jingles against
the iron butt of the spear and the spirit hears the noise and listens.
The puithiam returns from the spring to the house still chanting and
calling, and the spirit follows him, but should the puithiam laugh or
look back the spirit is afraid and flies back to the jungle.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Epidemics.</i>&mdash;The appearance of cholera, or
any similar disease, is the signal for the evacuation of the village.
The sick are abandoned and the people scatter, some families taking up
their abode in the jhum huts, others building huts in the jungle. The
neighbouring villages close their gates to all coming from the infected
neighbourhood, and to terrify the Huai, who is supposed to be
responsible for the epidemic, a gateway is built across the road
leading to the stricken villages, on the sides and arch of which rude
figures of armed men made of straw with wooden spears and dahs are
placed. A dog is sacrificed and the sherh are hung on the
gateway.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2259src" href="#xd24e2259" name=

barrenness in women.</b></span> <i>Chhim.</i>&mdash;This is generally
performed if a woman does not become enceinte in the first year of
married life. A white hen has to be caught just as it has laid an egg,
but as this is a somewhat difficult feat, and as the demons, though
malevolent, are supposed to be easily imposed upon, a white hen is
often caught and put into a nest basket with an egg and fastened there
till the puithiam arrives and says, &ldquo;Oh, ho! so your hen has laid
an egg!&rdquo; Then the hen is killed at the head of the sleeping
platform (khumpi), under which the sherh are placed in a basket till
sunrise next morning, when they are thrown away. The flesh is cooked on
the hearth and eaten. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"

<p class="par"><i>Nu-hrih.</i>&mdash;A black fowl is killed and eaten
as in the &ldquo;Chhim&rdquo; sacrifice. The sherh are wrapped in a
wild plantain before being placed under the bed in a basket. They are
thrown away in the morning. The feathers are bound with the thread used
for tying the woman&rsquo;s hair and hung on the wall opposite the
fireplace. Whether the couple cohabit on this night or not is
immaterial.</p>

<p class="par first">&ldquo;As soon as it gets dusk two men and the
puithiam go a short way down the road which leads out of the village
southwards taking a small pig with them, and there they make a fire,
and kill the pig and cook its flesh. They drink some zu which they have
brought with them in a gourd and also eat the flesh of the pig.
Presently they say no one is to come this way, and the puithiam sweeps
a place in the middle of the road and places some of the ashes from the
fire there, and sings this magic chant:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Animals come, animals of the Ri lake come,
animals of the Champhai come, animals from the village come, animals of
Ai-zawl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=

standing manes (bears), you with the branching horns come.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then, picking up some small stones and putting
them in their haversacks, they return. As they are about to enter the
chief&rsquo;s house, they say, &lsquo;We are bringing men&rsquo;s and
animals&rsquo; heads.&rsquo; The upas who are collected in the
chief&rsquo;s house ask, &lsquo;Are you friends or enemies?&rsquo;
&lsquo;We are friends,&rsquo; they reply. Then they open the door and
put the stones which they have brought into a basket, and as they enter
they are given zu.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The next day is &ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; for the whole
village. In the morning, early, they go to look at the ashes, and are
supposed to be able to see the likeness to footmarks in them, and thus
to what animals will be killed in the chase. If a man&rsquo;s foot
marks are seen, it is unfortunate, and a man will be killed.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ai.</i>&mdash;In order that a person after death may
gain possession of the spirits of the men or wild animals he has killed
here below, it is necessary for him to sacrifice a mithan, goat, or
pig. This is called &ldquo;Ai.&rdquo; After this feast, before the
skull can be placed in the front verandah, a religious ceremony has to
be performed by the puithiam. This is called
&ldquo;Sa-lu-an-chhuang&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Hoist the head
of the wild animal.&rdquo; A small white fowl is given to him and the
skull of the animal is placed in front of him. He then takes some zu in
his mouth and spits it out over the skull, and, after muttering a charm
in so low a tone that no one can hear him, he strikes the skull with
the head of the chicken. If some of the feathers stick on the skull it
is very lucky. After this the skull can be put up. As is stated further
on, the Lushais believe that the spirit of a dead man cannot pass to
Mi-thi-khua unless some animals are killed. These have to be provided
by the heir, and no greater objection can be urged against a claim to
inherit than a failure to provide the funeral sacrifice. This explains
the reason of the Ai ceremony; the performer thereby enables the spirit
of the dead animal to pass to Mi-thi-khua and in return acquires power
over it. No Ai has to be performed for tame animals, presumably because
they are the property of the slayer already. The word &ldquo;Ai&rdquo;
has many meanings&mdash;among them are &ldquo;to fascinate,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to obtain power over&rdquo;; and there is also a plant of that
name, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>which in one of the folk tales is said to have the
magical property of driving away any evil spirit at which it is
pointed.</p>
<p class="par">The Ai of a man requires the sacrifice of a mithan and a
small pig. If an enemy is killed and no Ai performed the slayer is very
likely to go mad.</p>
<p class="par">If you perform the Ai you can take your enemy with you
(as a slave) when you die; if you do not perform the Ai you cannot do
so, and the spirit of your deceased enemy will haunt you in this
life.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;When Bengkhawia&rsquo;s village was at
Thenzawl, a tiger beset the village and in one day killed a mithan and
two goats. The crier called on the people to surround it, and they did
so. Thangbawnga shot it and performed the Ai ceremony; the night before
he must not sleep. A young man cut its tail off; he also must keep
awake all night. The next day he performed the Ai ceremony, sacrificing
a mithan. Thangbawnga, who was performing the Ai, dressed himself up as
a woman, smoked a woman&rsquo;s pipe, wore a woman&rsquo;s petticoat
and cloth, carried a small basket, spun a cotton spindle, wore ivory
earrings, let his hair down, and wrapped a mottled cloth, which was
said to be of an ancient pattern, round his head as a turban. A crowd
watched him and yelled with laughter, but it would have been
&lsquo;thianglo&rsquo; for him to laugh. Presently he took off his
turban and carried it in the basket. Then he took off his woman&rsquo;s
disguise and dressed himself as a man, and strapped on a fighting dah
and carried a gun. He also took &lsquo;sailungvar&rsquo; (white flints)
and put them into the tiger&rsquo;s mouth while he ate eggs. &lsquo;You
eat the sailungvar,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;who will swallow them the
quicker?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have out-swallowed you, you have not swallowed
yours; I have swallowed mine. You go by the lower road; I will go by
the upper. You will be like the lower southern hills; I shall be like
the high northern ones. You are the brave man of the south; I am the
brave man of the north,&rsquo; he said, and cut the tiger&rsquo;s head
three times with his dao. Then the men buried the body of the tiger
outside the village.&rdquo; If the tiger has killed men, his eyes are
gouged out with skewers or needles and thrown away; it is
&ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>for the performer to laugh, so he holds a
porcupine in his arms, and if he laughs by accident they say,
&ldquo;The porcupine laughed.&rdquo; The idea of the performer
disguising himself as a woman is that the spirit of the dead tiger may
be humbled, thinking that it has been shot by a woman; and the giving
of the flints while the performer eats eggs is to show the power of the
performer over the the tiger, as he eats the eggs easily, while the
tiger is unable to chew the flints.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Haohuk Ai.</i>&mdash;The Ai of a
&ldquo;haohuk,&rdquo; or gibbon, means a feast given to all who care to
attend. Twenty pots of zu are required, but they are of a small size. A
pig has to be killed and eaten. This Ai is especially necessary because
of the superstition connected with the killing of these animals, which
will be found in <a href="#ch1.5">Chapter V</a>.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote"><b>8. Sacrifices connected with
jhuming.</b></span> <i>Lohman.</i>&mdash;When the jhum house has been
completed, the sacrifice has to be performed by the owner of the jhum.
The puithiam has to be called and two fowls killed by him. A small hole
is dug in the ground under the house and lined with plantain leaves and
then filled with water, and three small stones are dropped in. The
puithiam cuts the throats of the fowls, allowing the blood to fall into
the hole. The sherh are then cut off and hung under the house, and the
rest of the flesh is cooked and eaten in the jungle. The next day is
hrilh. The first day after this on which they work, some rice and
vegetables are placed on the top of one of the posts of the house
platform as an offering to the R&#257;m-huai.</p>
<p class="par"><i>F&#257;nodawi.</i>&mdash;The chief prepares zu in his
house. Puithiam and two upas go just outside the village on the road to
the jhum and sacrifice a cock, and its wings are hung on either side of
the road and the sherh are placed in the middle of the road. Next day
is hrilh; no one goes out of the village except to carry water. This is
to make grain fill in the ear, and is performed in July.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.5">5.
Priesthood.</span> There is no regular priesthood; the nearest approach
to priests are the puithiam (great knowers). These men pretend to be
able, by feeling a sick man&rsquo;s pulse, to tell which sacrifice is
needed. The only training necessary is to commit to memory the various
&ldquo;hla,&rdquo; or charms, which have to be muttered while
performing the sacrifices. Any man who thinks he has a call
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>can acquire these from a puithiam on payment of a
fee of a few rupees. His success in his calling appears largely to
depend on luck.</p>
<p class="par">There is generally one puithiam appointed by the chief,
but there is no limit to the number there may be in a village. As has
been said, the important Sakhua sacrifice requires the presence of a
puithiam of the clan concerned, but other sacrifices can be performed
by a puithiam of any clan. The services of a puithiam are not given
gratis. For performing those connected with cultivation he receives a
basket of rice; for other sacrifices he receives sums varying from a
rupee up to ten rupees, but for some it is not customary to take
payment, and the fees depend chiefly on the position of the person who
has to pay them, as the puithiam, on the principle that half a loaf is
better than no bread, will generally perform a sacrifice and take what
he can get rather than get nothing. For the more important sacrifices,
the fees, however, are always higher.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.6">6. Ceremonies
connected with child birth.</span> The particular sacrifices to be
performed in connection with a child&rsquo;s birth vary considerably in
different clans and families. Within seven days of the birth, the
sacrifice known as the &ldquo;Arte-luilam,&rdquo; consisting of a cock
and a hen killed just outside the house, must be made; till this is
done the woman cannot go to the spring and is &ldquo;sherh,&rdquo; and
had better not leave the house.</p>
<p class="par">Should the woman not observe the custom the child will
suffer in health. Three days after the birth of a child a small chicken
and seven small packets of rice and vegetables are suspended under the
edge of the front verandah. This is called &ldquo;arte-hring-ban&rdquo;
or &ldquo;khaw-hring-tir.&rdquo; The object is to satisfy the
&ldquo;khawhring&rdquo; (<i>see</i> <a href="#ch1.5.5">Chapter V, para
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2407" title="Source: 12">5</span></a>) and
prevent it entering the child.</p>
<p class="par">If a woman has difficulty in bringing forth, a fowl is
killed and divided equally. The portion with the head is put at the
upper end of the village with seven pieces of cane rolled into bundles,
the other half at the lower end of the village with five rolls of cane,
and the woman is given a little water to drink. This is called
&ldquo;arte-pum-phelna&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;to open the
stomach with a fowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For seven days after a child&rsquo;s birth its spirit is
supposed not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>to be quite at home in the little body and to
spend some of its time perched like a bird on the parents&rsquo; bodies
and clothes, and therefore, for fear of injuring it, the parents keep
as quiet as possible for these seven days. If either of the parents
works during these seven days and a red rash appears on the child, the
illness is called &ldquo;borh,&rdquo; and the cure, which is called
&ldquo;borh keo,&rdquo; is as follows:&mdash;A certain creeper called
&ldquo;vomhrui&rdquo; is brought and coiled round and round, forming a
sort of cylinder, and into this the child is dipped three times. This
is done at night after the fire is out, and no fire can be lit again
till morning.</p>
<p class="par">Two days after the birth of a child its parents give a
big drink to their friends and relatives&mdash;this is called
&ldquo;nau&rdquo;&mdash;and seven days later another big feast is
given. Some families give the name at the first feast, some at the
second. The proper custom is for the &ldquo;pu&rdquo; to name the
child, but nowadays parents generally do this.</p>
<p class="par">Should several children have died young, the parents
will carry the next baby and deposit it in a friend&rsquo;s house, and
then come and ask, &ldquo;Have you a slave to sell,&rdquo; and purchase
it for a small sum. This is supposed to deceive the Huais. Such
children&rsquo;s names always begin with Suak,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2424src" href="#xd24e2424" name="xd24e2424src">4</a> and, judging
from the frequency with which such names are met, the custom must be a
very common one.</p>
<p class="par">It is thought good to appoint a &ldquo;pu.&rdquo; The pu
kills a pig and a fowl and eats it with his friends. Some of the
&ldquo;fep&rdquo; of the fowl are tied round the child&rsquo;s neck.
The pu is a general protector, and he only can get the
&ldquo;pushum&rdquo; of a girl. He also receives the
&ldquo;lukawng&rdquo; (see Part 8). Should a woman die in childbirth,
it was considered unlucky for another woman to rear the child, which
was buried alive with its mother.</p>
<p class="par">There are no ceremonies connected with attaining the age
of puberty. A boy simply joins the young men in the zawlbuk. After this
it is considered unlucky to cut the hair.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.7">7. Marriage
ceremonies.</span> A young Lushai as a rule chooses his own bride, but
the arrangements are made by the parents. The would-be
bridegroom&rsquo;s parents select two male friends, called
&ldquo;palai,&rdquo; who go to the parents of the selected girl and
arrange matters. If the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>parents are agreeable the palai go on
another day with zu, and the girl&rsquo;s parents brew zu. The price to
be paid is fixed by custom, as before explained, but the amount to be
paid down has to be settled by negotiation, and this is often a long
business, the palai urging the poverty of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
family, while the bride&rsquo;s parents try to fix the sum as high as
possible. When this difficulty has been overcome the palai go again
with zu, and the girl&rsquo;s parents also provide zu. On that day the
girl is escorted by her friends to the house of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
parents. This is called &ldquo;Loi.&rdquo; As they pass through the
village all the children pelt them with dirt, but on arrival they are
welcomed with brimming cups of zu, and the bridegroom says to the
bride, &ldquo;Oh! your cloth is dirty,&rdquo; and gives her a new one.
After some time the bridegroom produces a fowl, and this is killed by
the puithiam, who says certain charms while doing so. This fowl is
called &ldquo;rem &#257;r&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the fowl of
agreement&rdquo;&mdash;and directly it is killed the bride and
bridegroom pledge each other in zu. Then the bride and her young
friends retire, while the rest of the party remain and have a great
feast, consuming the &ldquo;rem &#257;r,&rdquo; and also the fowls and
zu, which the bridegroom receives from the bride&rsquo;s aunt, pu,
thian, and p&#257;l&#257;l. The next day towards evening, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s mother or other elderly female relative goes to the
bride&rsquo;s house accompanied by two or three young girls, and they
escort the bride to her husband&rsquo;s house and hand her over to him.
The young companions of the bridegroom sometimes amuse themselves by
collecting a number of fowls under the house, tying she-goats up in the
verandah, while the kids are tied at the far end of the village, and
throw stones at the house throughout the night, so that the happy
couple get but little sleep. This is called &ldquo;Inngaithlak.&rdquo;
On the following morning the bride returns to her mother&rsquo;s house,
and for some time, occasionally for several weeks, the bride will spend
her days at her mother&rsquo;s house, only going to her husband&rsquo;s
after dark.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.8">8.
Funerals.</span> Different clans have different methods of disposing of
their dead. The following is the custom of all true Lusheis, whenever
the means of the deceased&rsquo;s family are sufficient to meet the
expenses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Directly after death the corpse is washed, the hair
dressed carefully, and then the body is attached to a bamboo frame,
placed in a sitting position, and adorned with fine raiment, necklaces,
&amp;c.; if the deceased was a man his gun, dao, &amp;c., are put near
him. In Lushei families the corpse is put on the floor at the head of
the kumpui. In other clans it is placed against the wall on one side.
If the family be rich a mithan, a pig, a dog, and a goat are killed,
but at least one of these must be killed. The flesh is then cooked in
anticipation of the arrival of the friends and neighbours who are
invited to a funeral feast, &ldquo;R&#257;l,&rdquo; which is kept up
with singing and drinking till the evening of the next day. Food and
drink are offered at intervals to the corpse. The spirits of the
animals killed are supposed to accompany the soul of the deceased to
Mi-thi-khua. If these animals are not killed the soul of the deceased
will either not reach Mi-thi-khua, or if it does will be very poorly
off there. So far there is not much difference between the Lushei
custom and that of other clans. The other clans, on the evening of the
day after the death, bury the deceased outside the house, without any
particular ceremony. The nearest male relative makes a short farewell
speech wishing the deceased a pleasant journey and asking him to
prepare things for those who have to follow him. With a man are buried
his pipe, haversack, and flint and steel; with a woman only the two
first. As regards the burying of food and drink and weapons the custom
varies, but it is generally done.</p>
<p class="par">The Lusheis, however, prefer not to bury their dead. The
body is placed in a box made by hollowing out a log, a slab of wood is
placed over the opening, and the joint plastered up with mud. This
rough sort of coffin is placed in the deceased&rsquo;s house near to
the wall. A bamboo tube is passed up through the floor and through a
hole in the bottom of the coffin and into the stomach of the corpse.
The other end is buried in the ground. A special hearth is made close
to the coffin and a fire is kept burning day and night on this for
three months, and during the whole of this time the widow of the
deceased, if he leaves one, must sit alongside the coffin, over which
are hung any valuables owned by the deceased. About six weeks after
placing the corpse in the coffin, the latter is opened to see if the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>destruction of the corpse is proceeding properly,
and if necessary the coffin is turned round so as to present the other
side to the fire. The opening of the coffin is celebrated by the
killing of a pig and the usual drink, and is known either as
&ldquo;en-lawk&rdquo; or looking, examining.</p>
<p class="par">When it is thought that everything but the bones has
been destroyed, the coffin is opened and the bones removed. The skull
and the larger bones are removed and kept in a basket, which is placed
on a special shelf opposite the hearth. The remainder of the bones are
collected and buried generally in an earthenware pot.</p>
<p class="par">On the occasion of the final opening of the
coffin&mdash;&ldquo;khuang pai,&rdquo; &ldquo;throwing away
coffin&rdquo;&mdash;it is customary for chiefs to kill a mithan; lesser
people are content with the usual drink. Few Lusheis, except chiefs,
can afford the expense incurred in this method of disposing of their
dead, and in such cases the body is simply buried. It is customary for
relations and friends of the deceased to send animals to be killed in
his honour, and the spirits of these are supposed to belong to the
spirit of the deceased in the Mi-thi-khua.</p>
<p class="par">The skulls of all animals killed on such occasions are
placed on poles round the grave if the body has been buried. If the
body has not been buried, the heads will be placed on poles round the
&ldquo;lung dawh,&rdquo; or platform erected in memory of the deceased.
These &ldquo;lung dawh,&rdquo; in most cases, are merely a rough
platform of logs placed beside the road just outside the village, but
in the case of chiefs and of men who have killed men in war, the
platform is built of stones. A big upright stone is placed in the
centre, and on this various figures are roughly outlined, representing
the deceased and sometimes his wife and children and the various
animals he has killed. An indiarubber-tree is very often planted by a
chief&rsquo;s grave. Sometimes a person who either has no near
relatives, or who mistrusts those he or she has, will get the young men
of the village to build the lung dawh during his or her lifetime.</p>
<p class="par">An aged couple with no relatives expended all they had
on a feast to the young men who brought and set up a big stone. The old
people were carried in sitting on the stone and cheerfully <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>superintended the feast, and a month later
peacefully departed this life.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2462src"
href="#xd24e2462" name="xd24e2462src">5</a></p>
<p class="par"><i>Hlamzuih.</i>&mdash;If the first child in a family
dies shortly after birth, it is buried without any ceremony under the
house, and it is called &ldquo;hlamzuih&rdquo; (hlam = after birth,
zuih = to follow). Should other children subsequently die, however
young they be, they will be honoured with a complete funeral. It will
be remembered that the hlamzuih are exempt from being shot by Pupawla.
(See above, page 62).</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lukawng.</i>&mdash;On a person&rsquo;s death a sum,
varying from Rs. 2/- to Rs. 20/- according to family custom, has to be
paid by his heir to the pu of the deceased (see para. 6). A chief
generally claims the &ldquo;lukawng&rdquo; of all his boi.</p>
<p class="par"><i>S&#257;r-thi.</i>&mdash;Deaths from accidents, in
childbirth, or those caused by wild animals, or in war are termed
&ldquo;s&#257;r-thi,&rdquo; and the corpse must not be buried within
the village; in some cases the corpse must not even be brought into the
village, if the death occurred outside. Even if the corpse is brought
into the village, it is often not allowed into a house, but deposited
in the forge. In such cases no lukawng can be demanded. Should the
injured person survive for any considerable time, the death will not be
called s&#257;r-thi unless the person has been wounded by a tiger. The
fact that tigers eat men is given as the reason for this. The graves of
persons killed by tigers are watched by the young men of the village
for several nights, lest the tigers, or their elder brothers the wild
cats, should come and dig up the body.</p>
<p class="par"><i>In-thian, Thi-thin.</i>&mdash;Three months after a
death a small chicken is killed and placed with some rice on the shelf
which runs along the wall. The family indulge in zu. This is apparently
a sort of farewell to the soul.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.4.9">9.
Festivals.</span> There are three feasts connected with the crops. They
are all known as &ldquo;Kut.&rdquo; The first is called
&ldquo;Ch&#257;p-ch&#257;r-kut&rdquo;; it is the most important of the
three, and is held after the jhums are burnt, about the time of sowing,
and is never omitted. It lasts three or four days. On the first day a
pig is killed by each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>householder who can afford it and zu is
drunk. On the second day, about 4 p.m., the whole population gathers in
the open space in the village, dressed in its best. Everyone brings
platters of rice, eggs, and flesh, and tries to force the food down the
throats of their friends. After dark the young men and girls collect in
houses of well-to-do people with several daughters and dance
&ldquo;Chai&rdquo; till daylight.</p>
<p class="par">The Chai consists in all the young men sitting with
their backs to the walls, each with a girl sitting between his knees
with her back to him. Individual performers dance in the middle, the
remainder singing and clapping hands. On the third day the young men
and girls collect in the centre of the village and form a circle, every
girl being between two youths, whose arms cross over her neck, holding
in their hands cloths which hang down behind like a curtain. Inside the
circle is a drummer or gong-beater, who chants continuously, the young
people taking up the refrain, and treading a slow measure in time with
the song, while cups of zu are brought to them in rotation. Fourth day,
&ldquo;Zuting-ni.&rdquo; The performance is repeated again if the

<p class="par">In villages where there are many R&#257;lte,<a class=

they kill their pigs the next day after the Lusheis and the other
ceremonies are postponed one day.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Mim-kut.</i>&mdash;Named after the maize, as it takes
place when the crop ripens. It is of but little importance and seems
likely to die out. Cakes of Job&rsquo;s tears are eaten and the next
day is &ldquo;hrilh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Pawl-kut.</i>&mdash;Held at harvest time. Fowls are
killed and children, dressed in their finest clothes, are fed with the
flesh mixed with rice and eggs. The next day is
&ldquo;hrilh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The correct performance of the Ch&#257;p-ch&#257;r-kut
is thought to go far towards insuring a good crop for the year.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Thang-chhuah Feasts.</i>&mdash;The feasts which an
aspirant for the honours of Thang-chhuah must give are five in number
and have to be given in the order named, as they involve considerable
expenditure, but not within any specified time.</p>
<p class="par">1. <i>Chong.</i>&mdash;The feast lasts four days, the
first of which is called &ldquo;In-chhia-shem-ni,&rdquo; (day for
repairing the house). The floor in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>the house is strengthened to
make it safe for the large number of guests. The labourers receive a
liberal allowance of zu in payment for their trouble. The second day is
called &ldquo;Zu-pui-ni,&rdquo; from the large amount of zu that is
drunk. The next day&mdash;&ldquo;Rawi-ni&rdquo;&mdash;two boars and a
sow are killed and there is a great feast. The last day is known as
&ldquo;Chang-do-ni,&rdquo; and on it the remains of the feast are
finished up.</p>
<p class="par">2. <i>She-doi<span class="corr" id="xd24e2520" title=
"Not in source">.</span></i>&mdash;The feast only lasts three days. The
first day is &ldquo;In-chhia-shem-ni,&rdquo; the second is known as
&ldquo;She-shun-ni&rdquo; (mithan slaughter day), and a mithan is
killed and eaten. The third day, known as &ldquo;Sa-ru-che-u-ni,&rdquo;
is similar to Chong-do-ni.</p>
<p class="par">3. <i>Mi-thi-rawp-l&#257;m.</i>&mdash;Three months
before the day fixed for the feast all the young men and girls of the
village start cutting firewood, for cooking the flesh of the animal to
be killed. A cane is stretched along from tree to tree beside one of
the main approaches to the village for some 500 yards, and against this
on alternate sides are rested the billets so that they may be
thoroughly dry by the time they are needed. As a reward the young
people receive a he-goat and a sow, which they consume with much
merry-making, the skulls being placed on posts at each end of the line
of billets. This collection of wood is called
&ldquo;sa-thing-z&#257;r&rdquo; (flesh-wood-hangout). The actual feast
lasts four days, which are known by the same names as in the
&ldquo;Chong&rdquo; and are spent in much the same way, but on the
Rawi-ni, besides the slaying and eating of mithan, effigies, supposed
to represent their deceased relatives, are made and attired in the
finest cloths and adorned with the best necklaces. These are strapped
on a square bamboo framework, in the centre of which on a tall pole is
an effigy supposed to represent the progenitor of the clan. The oldest
living member of the clan then comes slowly from his house, bringing
with him a gourd of zu, and gives each effigy in turn a little zu,
muttering a charm as he does so; he arranges his tour so as to reach
his own father&rsquo;s effigy last, and when he has muttered his charm
and given it the zu he dashes the gourd down on the ground and,
bursting into tears, rushes into his house, whence he must not emerge
for a month. The effigies are then carried about the village with much
shouting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This carrying about of their effigies is supposed to be
very pleasing to the spirits of the ancestors, and it is evident that
the people consider that these spirits are able to influence them for
good or for bad, though I have never had this view of the matter
clearly explained to me. This carrying about of persons on a platform
is considered an honour, and an instance of it will be found in the
description of the Fa-nai. It also appears among the Aimol and Tikhup.
Among the Manipuris or Meitheis the right to be carried in a
&ldquo;dolai,&rdquo; or litter, is much valued and is the prerogative
of certain officials, but is sometimes granted by the Rajah as a
personal distinction. The last day of the feast resembles the same day
in the Chong.</p>
<p class="par">4. <i>She-doi</i> as before.</p>
<p class="par">5. <b>Khuang-choi.</b>&mdash;This is the greatest feast.
Wood is collected three months before, as in the Mi-thi-rawp-l&#257;m,
but the collectors get a mithan and a goat as their reward. The feast
lasts four days, the names being the same as in the Chong. On the
Rawi-ni at least three mithan must be killed. The Khuang-choi really
completes the series, and the giver can now proudly wear the
Thang-chhuah cloth and have a window in his side wall, but it is
considered unlucky to stop, and after some time the She-doi is
performed again under the name of &ldquo;Tlip,&rdquo; followed in the
course of a year or so by &ldquo;Z&#257;nkhu&#257;n,&rdquo; a four
days&rsquo; feast similar to the Chong, but one or two mithan are
killed. If the fortunate man&rsquo;s life is prolonged he will continue
repeating these two feasts alternately. A man who has twice celebrated
a Khuang-choi is allowed to build a raised summer house called
&ldquo;zao&rdquo; a short distance in front of his living house.</p>
<p class="par">After slaying a mithan in any of these feasts the giver
of the feast is subject to various restrictions. Till he has performed
the &ldquo;In-thian&rdquo; ceremony, he may not leave the house nor
talk to anyone from another village. In some cases his movements are
not so closely restricted, but he must in no case cross running water.
I am told that should he infringe these rules his Sakhua would be
offended and he or his family would get ill. The &ldquo;In-thian&rdquo;
ceremony is performed some forty or fifty days after the killing of the
mithan, and consists <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90"
name="pb90">90</a>]</span>in the sacrificing of a cock. The prohibition
of conversing with strangers is generally enforced only for three or
four days, but on no account must they be allowed inside the house.</p>
<p class="par">The skulls of mithan killed on these occasions are
placed on posts to one side of the entrance to the house of the giver
of the feast, and it is the highest ambition of the Lushai to have a
long line of such posts in front of his house. Each post is cut out of
a tree of considerable size, which is dressed until the lower 7 or 8
feet are only some 8 or 9 inches thick. Above this the tree is roughly
cut into a plank some 8 or 9 inches thick, forming an irregular
quadrilateral, the lower side being a foot or so long and the upper
from 2 to 3 feet, while one side may be 18 inches and the other 2 feet
or a little more; at each of the upper corners there is a perpendicular
projection some 12 inches long terminating in a spike, a short distance
below which a ring of wood is left. The skull is placed on the higher
spike, while on the lower an egg is affixed by a thin peg of fir wood.
This use of fir may be a survival of the time when the clan lived east
of the Tyao, where fir forests are still found.</p>
<p class="par">Posts are erected on similar occasions by many of the
Kuki-Lushai clans. Among the Khawtlang the quadrilateral portion is
only two or three feet from the ground, while the projections are far
longer. Among the Vuite the custom is to put a thin straight post
slightly carved on one side of the house and to plant a number of
branches in a clump on the other. The Tangkhul Nagas, to commemorate
the slaying of cattle, plant lines of dead trees in front of their
houses.</p>
<p class="par">The method of killing the mithan at these feasts is
strictly laid down. After the puithiam has said a prayer, the giver of
the feast stabs the animal behind the shoulder in the region of the
heart, but only sufficient to draw blood. The poor beast is then
despatched by other men with sharp bamboos or clubs; it must on no
account be shot.</p>

<p class="par"><i>Buh-ai.</i>&mdash;This is a feast given by a wealthy
person who has had an exceptionally good harvest. It is not one of the
feasts which a would-be Thangchhuah has to give, nor is there any idea
of obtaining advantage in the next world, as there is in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>the Ai
ceremonies performed after the killing of animals or men, but it is a
thank-offering for a good harvest. It is not worth performing Ai for a
crop of less than 100 baskets. An old red cock and a pig are killed and
much zu prepared.</p>
<p class="par">There is a special pot of zu prepared on the platform in
front of the house of which no one who has not performed the Buh-ai can
drink, for others to drink of it is &ldquo;thianglo.&rdquo; The person
who gave the last Buh-ai feast is entitled to the first drink at this
zu, which is called the &ldquo;Buhza-zu&rdquo; (the 100 baskets of rice
zu). There is ordinary zu for the others to drink, and if it is not all
finished the first day the guests return on the morrow.</p>
<p class="par">The flesh of the animals killed is eaten by the guests.
At night the girls and lads dance the Chai, as in the
Ch&#257;p-ch&#257;r-kut. To give such a feast reflects great glory on
the giver and improves his standing in the village.</p>
<p class="par">The Buh-ai is celebrated by nearly all the Lushai-Kuki
clans and in some replaces the Thangchhuah feasts. Full particulars
will be found in Part II. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=

Legends.</span> There are many tales common to all the Kuki-Lushai
clans, though the names under which the various personages figure in
them are not always the same. A numerous class of legends deals with
the creation of the world and the first appearance of mankind thereon
and other natural phenomena; another class accounts for the names of
hills and rivers; a third class reminds one of Uncle Remus&rsquo;s
tales of the doings of Brer Rabbit; but there are also a great many
which are simply tales and which are generally a trifle obscene. The
following are instances of the first class:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Chhura is said to have shaped the world, beating it out
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2581" title="Source: fla">flat</span> with
his mallet. There are many tales connected with Chhura some of which
will be found further on. The following translation gives a
Lushai&rsquo;s idea of an eclipse of the sun or moon:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Formerly the Hauhul chief swallowed the moon,
having been changed during his dream into an awk, and many people were
watching and said, &lsquo;The awk is swallowing the moon.&rsquo; Then
he awoke and his mouth was bleeding. A year later he died and his ghost
was turned into an awk and went up into the sky, and the moon was full
and big, and the ghost, which had been changed into an awk, could not
swallow the moon, but the next day the moon was smaller and he
swallowed it. Thus men knew for the first time that there was an
awk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When an eclipse occurs there is much excitement
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2588" title="Source: an">and</span> beating
of drums, &amp;c. This is to frighten the awk, for the Lushais believe
that once the awk swallowed the sun so effectually that general
darkness prevailed. This awful time is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>called
&ldquo;Thimzing&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the gathering of the
darkness&mdash;and many awful things happened. Everything except the
skulls of animals killed in the chase became alive, dry wood revived,
even stones became alive and produced leaves, and so men had nothing to
burn. The successful hunters who had accumulated large stocks of the
trophies of their skill were able to keep alive using them as fuel, and
some of their descendants still survive among the Thados, under which
heading they will be found in Part II. As it was pitch dark, neither
animals nor men could see at all, and tigers went about biting wildly
at trees, stones, and people. A general transformation took place, men
being all changed into animals. Those who were going merrily to the
jhum were changed into &ldquo;satbhai&rdquo; (laughing thrushes), as
can be known by their white heads, which represent the turbans worn by
the men, and their cheery chatterings. People wearing striped cloths
became tigers, the chiefs of those days being represented by the
hornbills of to-day, whose bills represent the bamboo rods for stirring
rice while cooking; but another version is that the chiefs became
king-crows, whose long tail-feathers the chiefs value much and wear as
plumes. The black hands of the gibbon prove clearly that his ancestors
were dyeing thread when the Thimzing occurred. Another version ascribes
the same origin to the crows. Similarly those who were carrying torches
finding their way down stream beds were changed into fireflies. The
Chongthu family are sometimes said to have been turned into monkeys,
the Vangchhia into elephants; but another version says the elephants
were old women who were wearing their
&ldquo;puanpui&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, cotton quilts&mdash;with the
tufts of cotton outside. Wrestlers were suddenly transformed into
bears, who to this day grapple with their foes.</p>
<p class="par">The Paihte or Vuite clan became a species of squirrel,
while the R&#257;lte&rsquo;s ancestor was just saying, &ldquo;Vaibel
kan chep te ang nge?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall we suck our pipes?&rdquo; and
was therefore changed into a sort of squirrel called
&ldquo;chepchepa,&rdquo; from the sound it is always making.</p>
<p class="par">The domestic animals were changed into wild ones, but a
number of large boulders in the Van-laiphai are said to represent
Chhura&rsquo;s mithan which were grazing there at the Thimzing. After
this terrible catastrophe the world was again <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>repeopled by men and women issuing from a hole in
the earth called the &ldquo;Chhinglung,&rdquo; which appeared to me to
be a disused &ldquo;cache&rdquo; in which some long forgotten chief
used to hide his valuables on the approach of danger. Mithan reappeared
from gourd seeds, as is shown by their bellow &ldquo;um
mu&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, gourd seed. Pigs issued from the Rih-lake,
wherefore they come to their food when called &ldquo;rih rih.&rdquo;
Fowls were re-created from the mud, so to this day they answer to the
call &ldquo;chirih chirih,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;chir
mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is not quite clear how, if representatives of the
different clans were changed into various animals, these same clans
again issued from the Chhinglung, but our own legends are not always
quite easy to follow.</p>
<p class="par">The following is a translation of a Lushai account of
the repeopling of the world and of a feast which is said to have taken
place soon after:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The place whence all people sprang is called
Chhinglung. All the clans came out of that place. Then two R&#257;lte
came out together, and began at once chattering, and this made Pathian
think there were too many men, and so he shut down the stone. After a
short time Thl&#257;ndropa was going to hold a Khuangchoi, and told
them to call together all the people of the world, and when this had
been done he held his Khuangchoi. They said to the sun, &lsquo;Do not
shine, because we want our leader the S&#257;-huai (Loris) to lead us
in the dance,&rsquo; and the sun said, &lsquo;All right.&rsquo; At that
time the S&#257;-huai and all the animals could talk, and the bamboo
rat was beating the drum, and they all danced, and in the middle of
their fun the sun said, &lsquo;Oh, how I do want to look,&rsquo; and
shone out, and all the animals got hot, and could not dance any more,
so the S&#257;-huai got angry and quarrelled with the sun, and
won&rsquo;t even look at it nowadays. There was a great feast of flesh,
but the owl got no meat, so he got angry, and went and sat on the bough
of a tree, and Zuhrei, the big rat, chaffed him and said, &lsquo;Buka
has eaten his fill.&rsquo; Then the owl being still hungry, got angry
and bit Zuhrei. Since that day they have been at war, and if the owl
sees Zuhrei he assuredly bites him.&rdquo; The point of the allusion to
the R&#257;lte is that this clan is famed throughout the Hills for the
loquacity of its members. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Another story connected with this feast is that
Thl&#257;ndropa gave a number of presents: to the ancestor of the Poi
or Chin tribes he gave a fighting dao, while the ancestor of the
Lushais only received a cloth, which is the reason that the Poi tribes
are braver than the Lushais. On my asking what the ancestor of the
white man had received, I was told he had received the knowledge of
reading and writing&mdash;a curious instance of the pen being
considered mightier than the sword.</p>
<p class="par">Thl&#257;ndropa appears to have been a great person in
his day, for he is supposed to have received Khuavang&rsquo;s daughter
in marriage, giving in exchange a gun, the report of which we call
thunder. This legend puts Khuavang on a par with Pathian, and supports
the theory that the differentiation is of comparatively recent
growth.</p>
<p class="par">There is a legend that the king of the Water Huai fell
in love with Ngai-ti (loved one) and, as she rejected his addresses and
ran away, he pursued her and surrounded the whole human race on the top
of a hill called Phun-lu-buk, said to be far away to the north-east. As
the water kept on rising, to save themselves the people threw Ngai-ti
into the flood, which thereupon receded. It was the running off of this
water which cut up the surface of the world, which Chhura had levelled,
into the deep valleys and high hill ranges of which the whole world as
known to the ancestors of the Lushais consisted.</p>
<p class="par">As a sample of the second class of tale, the following
story regarding the origin of the Tui-chong river, which joins the
Kurnaphuli, near Demagri, may be taken:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Nine miles from Demagri, on the Lungleh road, the
traveller has to cross the Tui-chong river, one of the largest
tributaries of the Kurnaphuli, on which Chittagong stands. This river,
according to the Lushais, owes its origin to the self-denial of a girl
called Tui-chongi, who, with her little sister Nuengi, was walking on
the hills whence the river rises. It was April, and the sun blazed down
on them. Nuengi began to cry for water. &ldquo;How can I get you water
on the top of a hill? Don&rsquo;t you know that all the springs are
dry, for are not the jhums ready to be burnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;Water,
water, or I shall die,&rdquo; wailed Nuengi. &ldquo;Would you rather
have water than me?&rdquo; asked Tui-chongi. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get water, I shall die,
and then of what use would you be to me?&rdquo; replied the spoilt
child. So Tui-chongi, to satisfy her youngest sister&rsquo;s thirst,
changed herself into a river, and Nuengi drank and was satisfied. But
the water flowed down among the hills and burst its way into the
country of the Bengalis. The king of the Bengalis was astonished to see
so mighty a river flowing past his palace, and sent some of his people
to find out whence it came. They journeyed many days, till at length
they reached the source of the stream, and there sat Nuengi, who, now
that her thirst was satisfied, would gladly have had her sister back
again to show her the way home. The explorers were astonished to find
so beautiful a maiden sitting thus in the middle of the jungle, and
decided that it would be wise to take her back to their master, who
liked pretty girls. So Nuengi was added to the harem of the king of
Chittagong, and in time became the mother of a most lovely boy. The
king&rsquo;s chief wife, on seeing the child, thought to herself,
&ldquo;If my lord sees this jungle woman&rsquo;s brat, he will
assuredly love her more than me who am childless.&rdquo; So she had the
child thrown into the river, which flowed under the palace windows, and
frightened Nuengi into keeping silence on the matter. Tui-chongi,
however, in spite of the change in her circumstances, remembered her
little sister, and cherished the child so that he grew and throve. In
the same way six more children were born and thrown into
Tui-chongi&rsquo;s fostering arms. When they were grown up Tui-chongi
told them the circumstances of their birth, and sent them to dance on
the roof of their father&rsquo;s palace, who, hearing the noise, came
out to see the cause of the disturbance. When he saw seven handsome
young men he was much astonished, and asked them who they were.
&ldquo;We are your sons,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Why do you lie to
me?&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;liars have short lives in my
kingdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, O king, we lie not; we are Nuengi&rsquo;s
sons&rdquo;; and they told him their story. So the king smote off the
head of the bad queen, and installed Nuengi in her place.</p>
<p class="par">Of the third class the following are good examples, and
admirers of Uncle Remus will be reminded of the doings of &ldquo;Brer
Rabbit and the other animals.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

para. 6</a>) out of them and he sat in the fork of a tree and played on
it. The Quail, hearing the sound, came up. &ldquo;Hallo, Monkey! let me
play for a bit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; said the Monkey,
&ldquo;you will fly off with the <span class="corr" id="xd24e2652"

that,&rdquo; said the Quail, &ldquo;hold me by the tail.&rdquo; So the
Monkey held him tight by the tail, and off he flew, but the Monkey
pulled his tail clean out. Then the Quail came and begged for his tail,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>saying, &ldquo;Do give me back my tail.&rdquo; But
the Monkey replied, &ldquo;You can ransom it by paying eight
mithan.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Quail, &ldquo;if I have to
pay eight mithan for it, I&rsquo;ll just remain tailless,&rdquo; and
flew away.</p>
<p class="par">The following tale is interesting as showing the great
prestige the Tipperah chief enjoyed among the Lushais, who call him
&ldquo;Rengpui.&rdquo; There are many versions of this tale, some of
which are very long. I have been obliged to abridge it
considerably.</p>
<p class="par">Rimenhoiyi married Zawlthlia. Their house was of iron.
They had an eight-fold iron door. They beautified the inside with iron
and brass things. They also had a window (<i>i.e.</i>, Zawlthlia was
Thangchhuah<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2664src" href="#xd24e2664" name=
"xd24e2664src">1</a>) and a platform to sit on&mdash;in fact they
wanted for nothing.</p>
<p class="par">Rimenhoiyi planted flowers, but there was one flower she
had not, called &ldquo;nipuipar&rdquo; (bright sun flower&mdash;a
creeper with scarlet flowers). When her husband was about to go in
search of it he said to her, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go outside the
house,&rdquo; and having filled the brass vessels with enough water to
last her many days, he went off. However, the supply ran short and the
lady went to the stream to wash, and one of her hairs was carried down
and swallowed by a fish, which was caught by the cook of the king near
the mouth of the river; and from out of the fish the cook pulled this
immensely long hair, and it filled a winnowing basket. The king sent
for the owner of the hair, and after many episodes she was brought to
him. Zawlthlia returning found his wife gone, but with the help of the
domestic animals he traced her, and, on arriving at the foreign
king&rsquo;s village he saw slaves fetching water; and, ascertaining
that it was for the new queen, he put one of the nipuipar into the
vessel, so Rimenhoiyi knew he had arrived. According to one version,
they resorted to the same subterfuge that Abraham and Sarah employed
when entering Egypt and lived happily till, the king&rsquo;s suspicion
being aroused, Zawlthlia was summarily slain. According to another,
Rimenhoiyi married them both, but as she showed a preference for
Zawlthlia the king killed him.</p>
<p class="par">With the help of a wise woman learned in charms
Zawlthlia was brought to life in a more beautiful form, and the king
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>so struck by the improvement in his appearance
that he asked to be allowed to undergo the same treatment, and was duly
killed, but, unfortunately for him, was by some accident restored to
life in the shape of a dog; but in this shape he seems to have found
more favour in the fickle fair one&rsquo;s eyes, and a child called
Uithovi was born, who, being very poor, begged for some land of
Zawlthlia, who had become king of the Tipperahs, and was told to take
as much as a buffalo hide measured. By cutting the hide into a very
thin strip he was able to measure a considerable area of ground, but,
not content with this, he voyaged far till he reached the place where
money was to be found, and he became very prosperous.
&ldquo;Nevertheless it was said that to the present day Kumpinu (the
Company&rsquo;s Mother&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the late Queen), who is a
descendant of Uithovi&rsquo;s, cannot get the better of Rengpui (the
Rajah of Tipperah). If the Sahibs fight against Rengpui, all their
crops fail, and much sickness occurs among them. Pathian once threw
down a cannon from the sky, and a great number of Kumpinu&rsquo;s
sepoys tried to move it, but could not, while a few of Rengpui&rsquo;s
men were able to drag it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Chhura is represented as a man of immense strength and
stature, of an easy-going disposition, but not much blessed with
brains. Thus one story tells of how, being on a visit, he was regaled
with a crab stew, which he had not tasted before, and liked greatly. He
inquired of what animal it was made. On his way home he forgot the name
and commenced searching. Someone seeing him looking about asked what he
had lost. &ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; replied Chhura; &ldquo;if I knew, would
I be looking?&rdquo; The passer-by remarked that he smelt strongly of
crab. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s what I was searching
for,&rdquo; cried Chhura much pleased, and went on his way. His mallet
head, a roughly dressed cylinder of stone, about 30 inches long and 18
in diameter, is pointed out to the curious, lying beside the path
between Leng and Lingvum, where it is said to have fallen when it flew
off the handle while Chhura was flattening the earth in the
V&#257;n-lai-phai valley some five miles away. A large spherical stone
in the same neighbourhood is pointed out as one of the pellets shot
from his pellet bow when he was at Thenzawl, many miles distant.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Tale of Him who Demanded His Sister&rsquo;s
Price.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">He went to the west to demand his sister&rsquo;s
price. The debtor gave him a bamboo stirring rod. If you stirred an
empty pot with this rod it was at once filled with rice. He returned
towards his village. On the way he stayed the night in the house of a
widow, and placed his stirring rod on the shelf over the hearth saying,
&ldquo;Granny, please don&rsquo;t stir your pot with my stirring
rod.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said she, but, while he was
walking about the village, she stirred her pot just to see what sort of
a stirring rod it was, and, behold, her pot was full of rice. &ldquo;It
is a very good stirring rod,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will just
exchange mine for it&rdquo;&mdash;which she did secretly. And the owner
of the magic rod went on to his village, and on arrival there he called
to his children, &ldquo;Set the water boiling to cook the rice.&rdquo;
His children replied, &ldquo;We have nothing to cook. What is the use
of boiling water alone?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have got rice, I&rsquo;ve got
rice,&rdquo; he said. So they boiled the water, and he stirred it hard
with his rod, but nothing came. &ldquo;If we stir more it will
come,&rdquo; he said, but nevertheless nothing came.</p>
<p class="par">Then he went off to demand the price from the debtor
again, who gave him a goat which passed nothing but amber and cornelian
beads, and said, &ldquo;Take it carefully home.&rdquo; &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; said he. He stayed the night at the same widow&rsquo;s
house, and when he was going out to stroll through the village he said,
&ldquo;Granny, you will be careful not to kick my goat on the rump,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said she, but directly
he was out of sight she kicked the goat and he passed many beads.
&ldquo;It is a good goat,&rdquo; she said, and secretly substituted her
own goat for it. Her guest went off and directly he reached his house
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>called out, &ldquo;Prepare strings for
necklaces. Prepare strings for necklaces.&rdquo; His children replied,
&ldquo;Father, we have nothing to put on the strings. What is the good
of the strings alone?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have got beads, I have got
beads,&rdquo; he cried. So they prepared a winnowing basket full of
threads. Then he gave the goat several good kicks on the rump, but it
only passed filth and bleated loudly.</p>
<p class="par">Then he went again to demand payment and was given a
mallet and a piece of cane. &ldquo;The name of this piece of cane is
&lsquo;Ramdia,&rsquo;&rdquo; they said. He set off for home and again
stayed in the same old woman&rsquo;s house and put Ramdia and his
mallet down among the firewood, and as he started for his stroll he
said, &ldquo;Granny, don&rsquo;t touch this cane, will you? It is
called Ramdia&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t touch the mallet either, will
you?&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, but no sooner was he
gone than, saying, &ldquo;They are valuable things,&rdquo; she touched
them both. The cane wound round and round her and the mallet began to
beat her. She was in terrible trouble and shouted to her neighbours;
wherever she went the mallet beat her and beat her till she died.</p>

Superstitions.</span> The Lushais are an extremely superstitious race;
any unusual occurrence is considered as portending some evil results.
The meaning of the word &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; has been already
explained in <a href="#ch1.4.4">Chapter IV, para. 4</a>. Certain acts,
dreams, or sights are universally considered &ldquo;thianglo,&rdquo; or
unlucky, but should a Lushai see any unusual sight or hear an unusual
sound he would at once consider that some misfortune was imminent and
take advice from the puithiam as to how it could be avoided. The
following are some of the superstitions connected with cultivation.</p>
<p class="par">It is &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; to find, in the proposed
jhum, a gibbon&rsquo;s skull stuck on a tree stump. If in burning the
jhum the flames make a peculiar huk-huk sound; if the khatchhat
(nightjar) calls by day, the jhum had better be abandoned. Should the
jhum cutter after his first day&rsquo;s work dream of water or rice all
will be well, but should he dream of a mithan chasing him or tigers
springing on him, he must not continue cutting the jhum, or he will
certainly get very ill and probably will die. If on the site of the
proposed jhum a &ldquo;thing-lu-bul&rdquo; is found, death will
certainly claim the cultivator should he persist in jhuming
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>anywhere near the unlucky object, which is a
kind of abortive tree growth without boughs or shoots, but covered with
bulbous excrescences, which sometimes remotely resemble the human form,
and if cut exude a blood-red juice. Should a tree have a pendant
protuberance, called &ldquo;thingzang,&rdquo; the jungle near must not
be cut. The rubbing together of two tree boughs is thought to denote
the presence of a Huai, who must be appeased by the sacrifice of a cock
and hen, the sherh being hung under the jhum house with some chips of
the tree. Brackish springs, known as &ldquo;sa-khi-shi&rdquo; (barking
deer springs), are supposed to be the abodes of Huai, who are generally
satisfied with the sacrifice of a fowl, the sherh being hung in a
basket over the spring, but if the Huai be greedy the jhumer will fall
ill, and then a pig and a dog must be sacrificed in the same
manner.</p>
<p class="par">The following are some of the superstitions about
animals:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">A Lushai named Kela visited Aijal; on the road he met a
rat, which stood up in the middle of the road and held its paws to its
head. &ldquo;What a curious rat!&rdquo; he said. Two days after he
reached his home he died. To see such a rat is certainly
&ldquo;thianglo.&rdquo; This incident happened a short time ago; no one
had ever heard of such a rat having been seen before, and the
unusualness of the occurrence, coupled with the death of Kela, was, to
the Lushais, proof positive of its being the cause of his death. The
Lushais tell me that sometimes a muskrat will be followed by her whole
family, each holding in its mouth the tail of the one in front; this
they call &ldquo;In tir mei kai,&rdquo; and whoever sees it will
certainly die. Should a bear on being shot fall on its back, and lie
with its legs in the air, the shooter will die. If a bird enters the
house prompt measures have to be taken to avert misfortune. The
puithiam is called and the bird captured. The house is festooned within
with the leaves of a certain tree, and the bird is thrown out of the
house by the puithiam, who, muttering various charms, advises it to
take itself off and carry its witchcraft with it. I came across, in an
old number of the <i>Outlook</i>, a translation of a Chinese poem said
to be dated about 100 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> in which the
following occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;When a wild bird enters a dwelling it
portends that the human occupant must go forth.&rdquo; The coincidence
is curious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The following translation of a Lushai&rsquo;s reason for
considering the sight of an atlas moth &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; shows the
origin of such superstitions. Atlas moths are rare in the Lushai hills.
The &ldquo;keptuam&rdquo; (atlas moth) was the letter bearer between
Pathian and the Vai (foreigner); and once when he was carrying
Pathian&rsquo;s letter to the Vai chief the keptuam made the letter
into wings, and flew away and disappeared, and Pathian was much
disturbed at the loss of his letter and at the disappearance of his
messenger, and he made mankind hunt for the missing keptuam. Now the
keptuam did not wish to be caught, so he said, &ldquo;Whoever sees me
will die&rdquo;; but as mankind did not know this they hunted and
hunted till at last one saw the fugitive and died, and so they learnt
that to see a keptuam is &ldquo;thianglo,&rdquo; and ever since if
anyone sees a male keptuam he will probably die.</p>
<p class="par">Should the fowls at midnight become terrified and make
an unusual sound like &ldquo;i-ak, i-ak&rdquo; someone will die. Should
gibbons be heard hooting during the night, they have seen the corpse of
someone who will fall from a tree or be drowned. As the gibbon retires
to rest even before the sun sets, it must be very seldom that their
shouts are heard at night. It is &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; to shoot a
gibbon, because at the Thimzing a man and a wife were changed into
those animals. The woman at the time was dyeing blue thread, and
therefore the palms of the hands of the female gibbon are black, though
the rest of the body is light coloured.</p>
<p class="par">The rhinoceros is also safe from attack on account of a
similar belief, the folds of his skin being supposed to be derived from
the folds of the cloths of persons who were transmogrified. The natural
result of killing one of these animals is that all members of the
slayer&rsquo;s family sicken and die, but this can be avoided if the
successful huntsman on his return to the village goes straight to the
zawlbuk or forge and remains there a whole day and night, after which
it is safe for him to enter his house, provided that he leaves his gun
and haversack behind and has changed all his clothes.</p>
<p class="par">It is, however, worth noticing that, though monkeys,
elephants, tigers, bears, &amp;c., are also said to have been men
before the Thimzing, there is no reluctance shown to kill them, and in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>fact the chiefs wear plumes of the king
crow&rsquo;s feathers, and hornbills&rsquo; beaks decorate many a
chief&rsquo;s verandah.</p>
<p class="par">When building his house the Lushai must be careful that
he does not put his hearth on the side of the house next to that on
which his neighbour has his. To do so is &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; and
illness will follow. It is not difficult to guess how this idea has
arisen. Lushai houses are generally built in lines one above the other
on the sides of a hill, and therefore it is more convenient to place
the heavy earthen hearth on the upper side where the posts are shorter.
This causes the hearths of all the houses in one row to be on the same
side, and, the custom once formed, any deviation from it is considered
unlucky. To dream of the auction of a
&ldquo;hlang&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the bamboo frame to which the
corpse is strapped during the funeral feast&mdash;is unlucky, and the
person seen by the dreamer to purchase it will certainly die.</p>
<p class="par">The following translation of a Lushai account of
&ldquo;tualsumsu&rdquo; is interesting:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are &lsquo;tualsumsu&rsquo; in dreams and
also while people are in a trance; the latter are the worst. If two
friends are sleeping and in their dreams one says to the other,
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2744" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>Go as
&ldquo;tualsumsu&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &lsquo;beating your
head on the ground&rsquo;&mdash;nothing will happen to the one who
goes, but the man who sends him will die. If anyone goes without being
told to go, and likes it, he will die, but if he says, &lsquo;Oh, how
it hurts my head!&rsquo; he will not die. Sometimes a person will go
beating his head on the ground and when roused from the trance know
nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following is another curious belief:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If a man dreams that with his friend they are
going to fly like &lsquo;Chawifa,&rsquo; and they, both carrying
burning maize cobs wrapped in old cloths in baskets, intend flying from
inside the house, and having come outside, his friend flies away, while
he himself stands on the end of the roof and cannot fly, his friend who
flew away will die quickly, while he who could not fly will live. And
he that flew away knew nothing of it, and the corn cobs wrapped in old
cloth were thrown up, and the people saw them blazing like fire. This
is extremely &lsquo;thianglo.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Lushais speak confidently of &ldquo;Chawifa,&rdquo;
and many say they have seen it. They describe it as a kind of meteor,
which flies through the village blazing brightly, and if it alights on
a house the owner must die. Compare the Lakher idea of
&ldquo;Chawifa,&rdquo; given in Part II., and the Manipuri
&ldquo;Sangaisel,&rdquo; in Mr. Hodson&rsquo;s book on the Meitheis,
page 121.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote" id="ch1.5.3">3. Snake
worship.</span> The Lushais do not worship snakes, but there are many
tales of &ldquo;rulpui&rdquo; (the big snake). Colonel Lewin in his
&ldquo;Progressive Exercises&rdquo; has written as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Throughout the Lushai Hills, among all the tribes
with whom I have come in contact, whether &lsquo;Toung-tha&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Khyoung-tha,&rsquo; sons of the hill or sons of the river, I
have always found that special attributes have been assigned to a
certain description of snake or serpent that is found in these forests.
I remember once we were camped peacefully beside the border of a small
hill stream; the shanties of leaves and grass which form our <i lang=
"fr">tentes d&rsquo;abri</i> in this part of the world had been
erected, and all the world (our world some 30 persons) was either
smoking the pipe of peace or stirring the pot of rice that was to form
the evening meal. Suddenly there arose a shout of &lsquo;Tchubba-gree!
Tchubba-gree!&rsquo; which is the Hill Arracanese for &lsquo;the big
snake, the king-serpent.&rsquo; Behold the camp in a ferment, each
stalwart young fellow seizing his dao and tightening his waistband. We
went forth, and indeed the snake was very big. His long sinuous growth
was at least 20 feet in length and bulky in proportion; he moved slowly
along, taking apparently no notice of the turmoil and confusion that
soon filled the wood around him. The Hillmen swarmed around his length
like ants, and in a few moments he was cut in pieces by dao strokes. I
noticed that each of my combatants as they ran up to the snake spat at
him before striking. On inquiring the reasons of this, I was informed
that in attacking a snake of this description, if he spat at you first
before you struck him, your fate was sealed, and strangulation was your
doom; but if you were speedy in salivation and forestalled his action,
then he was delivered a prey into the hands of his assailants. A
similar superstition formerly attached to the basilisk or cockatrice,
which was said to be able to fascinate or cause the destruction of man
or beast if it first perceived its victim before it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>itself perceived. Sir Thomas Browne, in
discoursing &lsquo;Of the Basilisk,&rsquo; says &lsquo;that veneration
shooteth from the eye, and that this way a basilisk may empoison, is
not a thing impossible; but that this destruction should be the effect
of the first beholder or depend on priority of aspection is a point not
easily to be granted.&rsquo; The flesh of this snake (which is a
species of python) is eaten by the Hill folk, and the fat of the
reptile is held to be a sovereign cure for all cuts and wounds, as well
as for more obscure diseases. In the household tales and fireside
stories of the people &lsquo;the big snake&rsquo; holds a prominent
place, and is vested with attributes of power and knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Colonel McCulloch, in his account of the Valley of
Manipur, 1859, page 32, mentions the belief of the Manipuris in a snake
god, and in fact the royal family is supposed to have sprung from a
snake god known as &ldquo;Pakhangba.&rdquo; Colonel McCulloch also
relates that a Kuki&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a Thado&mdash;who had left him
in perfect health, &ldquo;saw a black snake as large as his thigh,
which uttered a sound like that of an ox bellowing.&rdquo; &ldquo;On
his reaching his home he became ill, his belly swelled, and he has not
recovered his health.&rdquo; Compare this with the following
translation of a statement made to me by Hrangzova, a Lushai political
Chaprassie, in 1904:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When I lived at Thenzawl, I once saw a curious
object about 18 inches long, and about 6 inches thick, like a snake,
which kept standing up on its stumpy tail, and then falling forward. I
called my friend, who also saw it. When I got home I told my father and
mother, who were very frightened, and said it was
&lsquo;thianglo.&rsquo; They both died within the year. This was 12
years ago. The rulpui which I saw had not got feathers, but perhaps
that was because it was not big enough, as I am told the real rulpui
has feathers like that of a cock.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There are various places named after rulpui. On one hill
the body of a large snake is said to have been raised up on a pole, and
so big was it that its shadow fell on a hill many miles away, called
thereafter &ldquo;Rulpui-thlin&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Rulpui&rsquo;s
Shadow. The following is the translation of the story of the origin of
&ldquo;rulpui.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=

<h3 class="main"><i>Chhawng-chili and the Rulpui.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Once upon a time there was a girl called
Chhawng-chili, who was in her father&rsquo;s jhum. At the bottom of the
jhum in a hollow tree a snake had its nest, and the snake loved
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2788" title=
"Source: Chawng-chili">Chhawng-chili</span> very much. Whenever they
went to the jhum she used to send her younger sister to call the snake,
who used to come up and coil itself up in Chhawng-chili&rsquo;s lap.
The little sister was very much afraid of the snake and did not dare
tell her father. When the girls were going to the jhum, their parents
always used to wrap up some rice and vegetables for them to take with
them. On account of her fear of the snake, the little sister could not
eat anything. Then her sister and the snake ate up all the rice and the
vegetables, and the little sister stayed in the jhum house all day and
got very thin, and her parents said to her, &ldquo;Oh, little one, why
are you getting so thin?&rdquo; but she always said, &ldquo;Oh, father,
I can&rsquo;t tell you&rdquo;; but her parents pressed her to tell
them, and at last she said, &ldquo;My sister and the snake make love
always; as soon as we get to the jhum she says to me, &lsquo;Call him
to me,&rsquo; and I call him, and he comes up and coils himself up on
her lap, and I am so frightened that I cannot eat anything, and that is
why I am so thin.&rdquo; So they kept Chhawng-chili at home, and her
father and younger sister went to the jhum, and her father dressed
himself up to resemble Chhawng-chili, but he put his dao by his side;
then the little sister called the snake, who came up quickly and curled
itself up in her father&rsquo;s lap, and he with one blow cut it in
two, and then they returned to the village. On the next day
Chhawng-chili and her sister went to the jhum and her little sister
called the snake, but her father had killed it. So they came back to
their house, and found their father lying on the floor just inside the
door sill. Chhawng-chili said, &ldquo;Get up, father, I want to scrape
the mud off my feet&rdquo; (on the door sill), but her father would not
move. So Chhawng-chili scraped off the mud from her feet, and stepped
over the sill, and her father struck up and killed her. In her stomach
there were about 100 small snakes. They killed them and killed them,
but one escaped and hid under a dry patch of mithan dung, and grew up
and used to eat people, and when it got bigger it wriggled into the
&ldquo;rulchawm kua&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;feed snake
hole&rdquo;&mdash;and people of all villages used to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>feed
it. After a time it was not content with goats and pigs, but demanded
children. One day a Chin who was travelling noticed his host and
hostess weeping, and on asking the reason was told it was the day for
giving a child to the snake. &ldquo;I will kill the snake,&rdquo; he
replied, and, being provided with a goat, he slew it, and wrapped its
flesh round his dao and forearm and offered it to the <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e2796" title="Source: ralpui">rulpui</span>. When his
forearm had been swallowed, by a quick turn of his wrist he
disembowelled the monster. The place where this took place is on the
Aijal-Champhai road, some forty miles from Aijal. The Biate or Bete
claim to have been the people who fed the snake.</p>
<p class="par">If a &ldquo;thingsir&rdquo; (a snake of which the female

<p class="par">The entry of any snake into a house is looked on with
suspicion, and either portends misfortune or it denotes that the
sacrifice to Sakhua is urgently needed. If this sacrifice is not
performed speedily death may ensue.</p>
<p class="par">To see a snake with legs is &ldquo;thianglo.&rdquo; The
Lushais believe there are such creatures. My informant says it is only
nowadays that this is &ldquo;thianglo,&rdquo; inferring that formerly
such creatures were common and therefore attracted no attention. It is
the unusualness of the thing which makes the Lushai think it
&ldquo;thianglo.&rdquo;</p>

In the section dealing with superstition the subject of omens of
misfortune has been fully dealt with, and there is no need to say much
more, but the following extract from &ldquo;Asiatic
Dissertations,&rdquo; II, 1792, is interesting&mdash;it is from a
description of the &ldquo;Mountaineers of Tipra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If at any time they see a star very near the moon
they say, &lsquo;To-night we shall undoubtedly be attacked by some
enemy,&rsquo; and they pass the night under arms with extreme
vigilance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This belief may be accounted for by the superstition
that projects undertaken on such occasions are likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="par">Once when starting on a night expedition to capture a
rebel chief, I noticed my guide staring up intently at the moon, and he
expressed great satisfaction at seeing a star quite close to its edge,
and exclaimed that our expedition was now sure to succeed, which I am
glad to say proved true. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=

The Lushais are firm believers in witchcraft. There are several ways of
bewitching your enemy. Colonel Lewin has a tale in which the wizard
takes up the impression of a person&rsquo;s foot in the mud and puts it
to dry over the hearth, thereby causing the owner to waste away. Clay
figures into which bamboo spikes are thrust also figure in all cases in
which a person is accused of this offence. To cut off a piece of a
person&rsquo;s hair and put it in a spring is certain, unless the hair
is speedily removed, to cause his death. Several tragedies have
occurred on account of the belief in witchcraft. In 1897 three whole
families were massacred because it was thought that they were
bewitching a very aged chieftainess. The livers of the wizards were cut
out and portions carried to the sufferer, but unfortunately she died
before being able to taste them and thus prove the efficacy of the
remedy. So strong was the feeling about these wizards that four or five
households of their relatives had to be given a special and isolated
site, as no village would receive them.</p>
<p class="par">The following translation of a Lushai&rsquo;s account of
how mankind first learned the black art is specially interesting, as it
introduces Lalruanga and Keichalla, who are the heroes of many of the
oldest of the Lushai tales. Colonel Lewin gives some excellent stories
in his &ldquo;Progressive Colloquial Exercises.&rdquo; Keichalla is the
man who can become a tiger at will, and appears in many
tales:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dawi witchcraft was known to Pathian. Vahrika
also was something like Pathian. Vahrika had a separate water supply,
and Pathian&rsquo;s daughter was always disturbing it. Vahrika said,
&lsquo;What can it be?&rsquo; and lay in ambush. Pathian&rsquo;s
daughter came, and he caught her and was going to kill her, but she
said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me; I will teach you magic.&rsquo; So she
taught him, and Vahrika taught it all to Keichalla, Lalruanga, and
Hrang-sai-puia. Then Lalruanga went to court Zangk&#257;ki, and
Zangk&#257;ki, who was a friend of Pathian&rsquo;s daughter, bewitched
Lalruanga, who had forgotten his &ldquo;dawi bur&rdquo; (magic gourd),
and he said to Chaichim (the mouse), &lsquo;Go and fetch my dawi bur
which I put in my basket.&rsquo; So the mouse went to fetch the dawi
bur and got it, but the Tuiruang (Barak) river rose very high. The
mouse took the dawi bur in his mouth and started <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>to
swim over the river. The dawi bur was washed away by the river till it
stuck in the fish trap of the Thlangom tribe, who said, &lsquo;What is
this?&rsquo; The dawi bur was singing like anything. The Thlangoms
broke it open. No sooner had they opened it than they each acquired
knowledge of magic. Then the Thlangoms were chanting the magic song.
Some Mizo (natives of these Hills) who were passing through the village
also heard the song of those who knew magic. The Mizo saw a man eating
rice. &lsquo;May you be bewitched!&rsquo; they said. They bewitched him
in his rice eating, and for a year after whenever he ate cooked rice it
changed into dry uncooked rice, and it swelled inside him till his
stomach could not hold it and he died. Thus the Mizo learnt about
magic. Nowadays also there is magic, but those who know it won&rsquo;t
teach it without payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Lushais maintain that the tribes to the north of
them, such as Paihte, Bete, &amp;c., are very proficient at witchcraft,
while the Chins consider the Lushais such experts at the craft that
when Captain Hall, 2nd Gurkhas, and I forced our way from the west
through the then unexplored hills and joined General Symons at Haka in
1890, the chiefs of that village besought the General not to allow any
of our Lushai followers to go within sight of it, lest they should, by
merely looking at it, cause fearful misfortunes. The belief in the man
tiger is common through the Hills and also in Nepal. When a man-eater
gave much trouble in Lungleh, our Gurkha Sepoys maintained that it was
a man, one of three friends who had assumed this shape and were
travelling by different shapes to a previously selected rendezvous, on
reaching which they would resume their human forms.</p>

<p class="par"><i>Khuavang zawl.</i>&mdash;The Lushais believe that
certain persons&mdash;both males and females, but more generally
females&mdash;have the power of putting themselves into a trance and
are in a state of communication with Khuavang. This power is called
&ldquo;zawl,&rdquo; and a person who possesses it is called
&ldquo;zawlnei.&rdquo; During their trances they are said to be able to
elicit from Khuavang information regarding the particular sacrifice
required to cure any sick person, and their information is supposed to
be more reliable than the opinion of the puithiam, who bases his
statements <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>solely on the action of the pulse. The method of
interrogating a zawlnei is called &ldquo;thumvor,&rdquo; and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The zawlnei being in a trance is given a shallow basket
containing rice, which he or she holds in one hand while an egg is
placed in the palm of the other hand. When the zawlnei reverses this
hand the egg does not fall. The basket of rice is shaken backwards and
forwards, and there appears among the rice the footprint of the animal
which it is necessary to sacrifice to ensure the patient&rsquo;s
recovery. If it is impossible to trace any resemblance to any
animal&rsquo;s footmark the state of the patient is serious and the
whole series of sacrifices are needed. Compare the description of the
Maibi&rsquo;s method of divination given in McCulloch&rsquo;s account
of the Valley of Manipur, page 21. The following two accounts of
Khuavang zawl were given me by Lushais:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Lianthangi was a Khuavang zawl. There was much sickness
in the village. One night Khuavang came to her in her dreams and said,
&ldquo;If each house-owner will make a clay metna and place it outside
his or her house the sickness will cease.&rdquo; So they did this and
the next day they observed as &ldquo;hrilh,&rdquo; and within 20 days
everyone was well again.</p>
<p class="par">Thang-tei-nu was a zawlnei, but concealed the fact;
people used to come secretly and make her perform the thumvor, and said
she knew everything. She allowed no one to drink zu in her house, and
if she drank zu she always got ill and it was &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo;
for her to perform sacrifice. Khuavang told her this in her dreams.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Khawhring.</i>&mdash;In <a href="#ch1.4.6">Chapter
IV, para. 6</a>, the sacrifice called Khawhring Tir has been described.
The belief in Khawhring is universal, and from the following
translation it will be seen that the unfortunate women who were accused
of being possessed by such a spirit have good reason to be grateful
that the control of the country has passed into our hands. The belief
is that Khawhring lives in certain women, whence it issues forth from
time to time and takes possession of another woman, who, falling into a
trance, speaks with the voice of the original hostess of the Khawhring.
A missionary described to me a weird scene of excitement which he once
saw, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>object being to exorcise a Khawhring which had
possessed a girl. Amid a turmoil of shouting, drum-beating, and firing
of guns the spirit was ordered to quit its temporary abode and return
whence it came.</p>

Khawhring.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Wild boars have Khawhring. Once a man shot
a wild boar while out hunting. On his return home they cooked the
flesh. Some of the fat got on the hand of his sister, who rubbed her
head, and the wild boar&rsquo;s Khawhring just passed into her. On the
next day, without any provocation, she entered another girl. She took
entire possession of her. People said to her, &ldquo;Where are you
going to?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;It is the wild boar my brother
shot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;If
you will give me eggs I will go away,&rdquo; she replied. They gave her
eggs and she went. Presently all those who borrowed the
&ldquo;hnam&rdquo; (a plaited cane band for carrying loads) of the girl
with the Khawhring also got possessed. If one with a Khawhring has a
daughter the child is always possessed, so no one wants to marry a
person with a Khawhring. Even now, we being to some extent Lusheis, we
do not like to let a person possessed by a Khawhring enter our houses,
and if such a one sits on the bed of a true Lushei she will certainly
be fined a metna. Those possessed of Khawhring are most disgusting
people, and before the foreigners came they were always
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The writer was not a true Lushei, but belonged to one of
the clans which are fast being absorbed and are almost
indistinguishable from Lusheis.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushais say that sometimes girls walk in their sleep
and go and lick up urine, as the metna do, under the zawlbuk, and that
when starting forth on these expeditions their feet and hands shine as
if they were coated with phosphorus. If a young man wakes a girl up
while she is walking thus she is very much ashamed, and generally
grants him the favours of her bed to procure his silence.</p>
<p class="par">This state is called &ldquo;Thlahzung.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I propose, in this chapter, to deal only with
Lushai, and to treat of the connection between the different dialects
spoken in these Hills at the end of Part II.</p>
<p class="par">Lushai or Dulien, which is the dialect of the Lushei
clan, modified, doubtless, by contact with those of other clans, is now
the <i>lingua franca</i> of the whole Lushai Hills, and is understood
in many parts of the adjoining districts. A very complete grammar and
vocabulary has been published by Messrs. Savage and Lorrain, now of the
London Baptist Mission, and therefore I only propose to give a bare
outline of the language here, which is largely borrowed from the above
work.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Articles.</i>&mdash;The indefinite article can
generally be rendered by the numeral one.</p>
<p class="par">The definite article is sometimes represented by
demonstrative pronouns or relative particles.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Gender.</i>&mdash;Inanimate objects have no gender.
In nouns gender may be shown by use of different words, as
&ldquo;tlangval,&rdquo; a young man; &ldquo;nula,&rdquo; a maiden. This
system is only employed when speaking of human beings, by adding
suffixes&mdash;&ldquo;pa&rdquo; and &ldquo;chal&rdquo; for males,
&ldquo;nu&rdquo; and &ldquo;pui&rdquo; for females; thus &ldquo;fa
pa,&rdquo; son; &ldquo;fa nu,&rdquo; daughter; &ldquo;she chal,&rdquo;
bull metna; &ldquo;she pui,&rdquo; cow metna. &ldquo;Chal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pui&rdquo; are restricted to full-grown animals. All men&rsquo;s
names end in &ldquo;a,&rdquo; all women&rsquo;s in &ldquo;i.&rdquo;
Some words are the same in both genders&mdash;&ldquo;u,&rdquo; elder
brother or sister; &ldquo;nao shen,&rdquo; a baby;
&ldquo;naupang,&rdquo; child. &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the feminine
termination in Manipuri also. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"

of all enquiries I was unable to find out any reason for the name,

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In this part all the clans of the Lushai-Kuki race
which are not included by the people themselves among the Lusheis will
be briefly dealt with. All these clans practise the jhum methods of
cultivation and were originally semi-nomadic, but certain of them,
under changed circumstances, have ceased to move their villages and are
taking to plough cultivation. There is a varying similarity in the
religious beliefs and customs, and it will suffice to point out the
principal divergences from those of the Lusheis as already
described.</p>
<p class="par">The non-Lushei clans group themselves naturally into
five sections:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. The clans which live among the Lusheis under the rule
of Thangur chiefs and have become practically assimilated by them, and
are included in the wider term Lushai, as we use it. Naturally the
accounts of these will be brief and will deal principally with the
origin of the clans.</p>
<p class="par">2. The clans which, while still retaining a separate
corporate existence, have been much influenced by the Lusheis, among or
near whom they reside.</p>
<p class="par">3. The Old Kuki clans.</p>
<p class="par">4. The Thado clan with its numerous families and
branches, often spoken of as New Kukis.</p>
<p class="par">5. The Lakhers. These are immigrants from the Chin
Hills, and would more correctly be dealt with in the Chin Monograph,
but a brief sketch of them, though very incomplete, may be useful till
a fuller account is written. They call themselves Mara. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">CLANS INCLUDED IN THE TERM LUSHAI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">These clans have adopted most of the manners and
customs of their conquerors, and to an ordinary observer are
indistinguishable from the true Lushei. In many cases the only
difference is in the method of performing the Sakhua sacrifice. In few
cases some words of the clan dialect are still used, but, generally
speaking, there is but little difference noticeable. In cases where the
clan had attained considerable strength before its overthrow by the
Lusheis the process of assimilation has naturally been slower, and
there is more to describe. The following list of clans does not lay
claim to being complete, but contains all the best-known names.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Chawte.</span> Members of this
clan are found in small numbers scattered among the Lushei villages.
They kill a goat as the Sakhua sacrifice, and omit all the Naohri
sacrifices except the Zinthiang and Ui-ha-awr. When a mithan is
<span class="corr" id="xd24e5910" title=
"Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span> it is killed in the evening, and
the giver of the feast wears some of the tail hairs on a string round
his neck.</p>
<p class="par">In the hills between the Manipur valley and Tamu I found
two small hamlets of Chawte, who said that their forefather had come
from the hills far to the south very long ago. Their language closely
resembles Lushei, but they have come much under Manipuri influence. The
names of the families in no case agreed with those given me by the
Chawte in the Lushai Hills. A detailed account of the Manipur Chawte
will be found in (3).</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Chongthu.</span> This clan is
very widely scattered. The following account of the origin of the clan
is given by Suaka, now Sub-Inspector of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>Police at
Aijal:&mdash;&ldquo;Of all Lushai clans Lershia (Chongthu) celebrated
the Chong first of all. Lershia&rsquo;s village was on the hill to the
south of the Vanlai-phai. There he celebrated the Chong. He was the
richest of all men. Lershia had a younger brother, Singaia. His village
was separate at Betlu. He was very rich in mithan, gongs, and
necklaces. Once he was moving to another village with all his goods,
when a very big snake swallowed him. Even till now Chongthus are always
&lsquo;upa&rsquo; to chiefs. It may be they are wiser than the other
clans; they are very amiable&mdash;maybe they understand how to express
matters well. In every village Chongthu are always upa. How many
children Lershia had or where they are I do not know. Nevertheless he
was the richest of all men. Because he was so rich in mithan, gongs,
and necklaces he first celebrated the Chong. His name was also first
given to the Chong song. Even till now the Sailo and all Lusheis and
all Ralte, if they celebrate the Chong according to their customs, sing
Lershia&rsquo;s song&mdash;they have not a new song of their
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">From the above it would appear that Chongthu is a
nickname given to Lershia on account of his having first celebrated the
Chong. Chongthu&rsquo;s name appears in the Thado pedigree as the first
of the race to emerge from the earth, and the great-great-grandfather
of Thado. The Chiru and Kolhen also claim descent from him, though they
cannot give the intermediate names.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Hnamte.</span> This clan lived
to the east of the Tyao river. Their most famous chief was Chon-uma,
their last village was at Tl&#257;ngkua, on the Lentl&#257;ng. Bad
harvests and general misfortunes brought about their dispersal early in
the last century.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Kawlni.</span> A
widely-distributed clan sub-divided into at least 12 families said to
be connected with the Ralte, <i>q.v.</i></p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Kawlhring. Kawl = Burma. Hring
= Born.</span> This clan had a big village on the Hringfa hill, where
the remains of earthworks made by them in their final struggle against
the Haka people may still be seen. Messrs. Carey and Tuck in their
&ldquo;Chin Hills Gazetteer,&rdquo; p. 153, say:&mdash;&ldquo;Having
settled with their formidable neighbours on the north, the Hakas turned
their attention to the Lushais, who at this time occupied the country
as far east as the banks of the L&#257;v&#257;r stream, barely 20 miles
east of Haka. Their chief centres were Kwe Hring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and
Vizan, two huge villages on the western slopes of the Rongtlang range,
and to this day the sites, fortifications, and roads of the former town
may be traced.&rdquo; The Hakas, not feeling equal to attacking their
powerful neighbours single-handed, called in the assistance of a
Burmese chieftain, Maung Myat San of Tilin, who came with 200 men armed
with guns and bringing with them two brass cannons. &ldquo;The Haka and
Burman forces were collected on the spot where Lonzeert now stands,
and, marching by night, surprised Kwe Hring in the early dawn by a
noisy volley in which the brass cannon played a conspicuous part. The
Lushais, who had no firearms, deserted their villages and fled in
disorder, and for several months parties of Hakas ravaged the country,
eventually driving every Lushai across the Tyao before the rains made
that river unfordable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The people called here Lushais were the Kawlhring. The
last Kawlhring chief was Lalmichinga. The clan is now scattered among
the villages round Lungleh. There are eight families, but I have not
found any branches. The Zinthiang and Zinhnawm are omitted from the
Naohri sacrifices.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Kiangte.</span> This clan lived
east of the Manipur river, from which place it was driven by the Chins.
Kiangte are now found in small numbers in most of the villages in the
North Lushai Hills. The clan is divided into seven families, without
branches.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Ngente.</span> Although this
clan has been practically absorbed its members have retained in an
unusual degree their distinctive customs. The Ngente were formerly a
somewhat powerful clan living at Chonghoiyi, on the Lungdup hill, where
about 1780 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> a quarrel broke out between
their two chiefs, Lalmanga and Ngaia, and the latter set out with his
adherents to form another village, but was pursued and killed by his
brother. Shortly after this the clan was attacked by the Lusheis and
broken up. The above particulars were given me in 1904, when I was near
the Lungdup hill. They seem to account for the Koihrui-an-chhat
festival, which is described below from notes supplied to me by Mr. C.
B. Drake-Brockman in 1901, embodying information gathered by him from
Ngente living at Lungleh, many days&rsquo; journey from Lungdup. This
is an interesting instance of history being embalmed in a custom of
which the origin has been forgotten, and I humbly recommend its
consideration to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>those wise men who are ever ready to
interpret every custom as affording evidence of their particular
theories.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Marriage.</i>&mdash;The Ngente young man is no more
restricted in the choice of his wife than is the Lushei, but the price
is fixed at seven guns, which are taken as equivalent to Rs. 140/-. Of
this sum the girl&rsquo;s nearest male relative receives Rs. 120/-, the
remainder being distributed as follows:&mdash;Rs. 8/- to the
&ldquo;pu,&rdquo; maternal grandfather or uncle, Rs. 6/- to her elder
sister, Rs. 4/- to her paternal aunt, Rs. 2/- to the
&ldquo;p&#257;l&#257;l,&rdquo; or trustee. Should a woman die before
the whole of her price has been paid, her relatives can only claim half
the remainder.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Childbirth.</i>&mdash;Three months before the birth,
the mother prepares zu, which is known as
&ldquo;nao-zu&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, baby&rsquo;s beer, which must
on no account be taken outside the house and which is drunk in the
child&rsquo;s honour on the day of its birth. Women are delivered at
the head of the bedstead, and the afterbirth is placed in a gourd and
hung up on the back wall of the house, whence it is not removed. The
puithiam sacrifices a cock and hen, which must not be white, outside
the village, and, having cooked the flesh there, he takes it to his own
house for consumption. On the third day after the birth the child is
named by its &ldquo;pu,&rdquo; who has to give a fowl and a pot of zu.
A red cock is killed and some of its feathers are tied round the necks
of the infant and other members of the family.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Death Ceremonies.</i>&mdash;The Ngente do not attach
any importance to burying their dead near their place of abode. They
put up no memorials and offer no sacrifices, and make no offerings to
the deceased&rsquo;s spirit. The dead are buried wherever it is most
convenient. This is a most singular divergence from the general
custom.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Festivals.</i>&mdash;The Khuangchoi, Chong, Pawl-kut
are observed. In place of the Mim-kut they celebrate a feast called
Nao-l&#257;m-kut, which takes place in the autumn. For two nights all
the men and women must keep awake, and they are provided with boiled
yams and zu to help them in doing so. On the third day some men dress
themselves up as women and others as Chins, colouring their faces with
charcoal. They then visit every house in which a child has been born
since the last Nao-l&#257;m-kut and treat the inmates to a dance,
receiving presents of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>dyed cotton thread, women&rsquo;s
cloths, &amp;c., and much zu. Compare the account of the Fanai She-doi,
p. 136 <i>et seq.</i> below.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Koihrui-an-chhat (They Break the Koi
Creeper).</i>&mdash;A party of young men, being supplied with
hard-boiled eggs and fowl&rsquo;s flesh, go off into the jungle
equipped with bows and arrows. On the third day they return with the
heads of some animals&mdash;for choice those of the
&ldquo;tangkawng,&rdquo; a large lizard&mdash;and also a long piece of
the creeper from which the Koi beans (<i>v.</i> Chap. II, para. 18) are
obtained. They are received with all the honours paid to warriors
returning from a successful raid, and a tug of war with the creeper
takes place between the young men and the maidens. The heads of the
animals are then placed in the centre of the village, and dancing,
singing, and drinking go on round them all night, no young man or girl
being allowed to go inside a house till daybreak, when the whole party
adjourns to the house of a member of the Chonghoiyi-hring
family&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a descendant of one born at

<p class="par">It is quite clear that this feast commemorates the
victory of Lalmanga over Ngaia&mdash;compare the account of the
reception of a raiding party given in Part I., Chap. III, para. 9. The
use of bows and arrows is an interesting survival.</p>
<p class="par">The tug of war with the creeper is found among the Old
Kuki clans as one of the incidents of the spring festival, and in the
Manipuri chronicle we find references to such amusements being indulged
in. The Ngente evidently combined the play, intended to keep green the
memories of their ancestor, with the usual ceremonies of the spring
festival.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5994src" href="#xd24e5994" name=

<p class="par"><i>Language.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Linguistic Survey</i>
Dr. Grierson gives a translation of the parable of the Prodigal Son in
the Ngente dialect supplied him by Mr. Drake-Brockman, and sums up his
description of the dialect as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;But in all
essential points both (<i>i.e.</i>, Ngente and Lushei) agree, and the
difference is much smaller than between dialects in connected
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Paotu.</span> A very
insignificant clan, of which I have found only one family. The clan
formerly lived on a hill north of the Tao <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>peak, to the east of
the Koladyne, and were probably driven out by the Chins at the same
time as the Kawlhring.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Rentlei.</span> There are five
families in this clan, which has long been absorbed by the Lusheis, but
the Rentlei maintain that at one time, when they lived in a big village
on the Minpui hill to the east of the Tyao river, they were the more
powerful and showed their contempt for the Lusheis by throwing stones
at the skulls of the pigs which the latter used to place on posts
outside their houses after performing the Sakhua sacrifice, and this
led to the Lusheis placing the skulls inside their houses, whereas the
Rentlei to this day adhere to the custom of putting them outside. This
clan is still looked on with respect, and chiefs frequently take
Rentlei brides.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Roite.</span> This clan is
divided into seven families, one of which has a branch. There is
nothing of interest to be noted about it.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Vangchhia.</span> This clan has
only three families and one branch. Its members are said to be
generally wealthy, and therefore prudent parents strive to get them as
&ldquo;pu&rdquo; to their children. Their Sakhua sacrifice is
elaborate, a mithan being killed in front of the house, a cock at the
head of the parents&rsquo; bed, and a boar at that of the children.
There is a great feast, followed by nine days&rsquo;
&ldquo;hrilh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Zawngte.</span> Now an
insignificant clan, of which I have not obtained a single family name.
Under a chief called Chengtea they lived on a hill north of
Thlan-tlang, which is still known by their name. They were ejected by
the Chins probably at the same time as the Kawlhring and Paotu. The
eldest son inherits. They place their dead in hollowed-out logs in
small houses outside the village, and leave them there for three
months. In these particulars they resemble the Vuite. As among the
Chawte, after killing a mithan the household of the giver of the feast
wear some of the hairs of the tail on strings round their necks.

INFLUENCED BY THE LUSHEIS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first"><span class="marginnote">Fanai<span class="corr"
id="xd24e6044" title="Not in source">.</span></span> A clan which was
rising into eminence, when our occupation of the country put a stop to
its further aggrandisement. The chiefs trace their pedigree back six
generations, to a man called Fanai, who lived among the Zahaos, to the
east of the Tyao. His great grandson, Roreiluova, was a slave, or at
least a dependant, of a Zahao chief, and was sent with 70 households to
form a village at Bawlte, near Champhai, in Lushei territory, with the
intention, no doubt, of enlarging the Zahao borders, but Roreiluova
entered into peaceful relations with the Lushei chiefs, and gradually
severed his connection with the Zahaos, and, moving south-west,
occupied successively various sites to the west and north-west of
Lungleh, between the Lushai and Chin villages, maintaining his position
with considerable diplomatic skill, often acting as intermediary
between his more powerful neighbours. He died at Konglung early in the
nineteenth century, having attained such a position that his sons were
at once recognised as chiefs, and on our occupying the country in 1890
we found eight Fanai villages, containing about 700 houses, grouped
along the west bank of the Tyao and Koladyne rivers, between Biate on
the north and Sangao on the south. Roreiluova&rsquo;s descendants seem
to have inherited his skill in diplomacy, for they kept on good terms
with their neighbours, and whenever these quarrelled managed to assist
the stronger without entirely alienating the weaker.</p>
<p class="par">The clan is subdivided into six families and one
branch.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Fanai now talk Lushai and dress in the same way,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>except as regards the method of dressing the
hair, which is parted horizontally across the back of the head at the
level of the ears, and the hair above this is gathered into a knot over
the forehead, while that below is allowed to hang loose over the
shoulders. They generally follow Lushai customs. In the series of
feasts which an aspirant for the title of Thangchhuah has to perform,
the Chong is replaced by the Buh-za-ai (buh = rice, za = 100),
performed as among the Lushais. The She-doi feast has to be gone
through twice, and is followed by a very similar feast called
She-cha-chun (spearing of male mithan), which completes the series.
Wealthy persons perform the Khuangchoi, but it is not necessary. The
Mi-thi-rawp-l&#257;m is prohibited. The following account of the
She-doi is taken from my diary of the 14th May, 1890.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We went up at once to the village, where a
peculiar dance was in progress. Lembu&rsquo;s wife was being carried
about on a platform, round which a wooden railing had been fixed to
enable her to maintain her position. This platform had four long poles
passed underneath it, and a number of men and women, holding these,
were moving the platform about in a manner which must have been most
uncomfortable for her Majesty. They lifted it up and down, then swayed
it to one side, then to the other, then ran in one direction and
stopped suddenly, then in another, and pulled up with a jerk. During
all this time the royal lady maintained a solemn silence, and showed
complete indifference to the whole proceeding. Her head-dress consisted
of a band round which at intervals coloured bands of straw were
plaited. From this chaplet porcupine quills stood up all round, to the
ends of which the yellowish-green feathers of parrots were affixed,
each terminating in a tuft of red wool. At the back, an iron crossbar,
about 6 inches long, was tied horizontally, and from this a number of
strings of black and white seeds depended, at the end of which
glistening wing-cases of green beetles were attached. Except for this
startling head-dress, the Queen was dressed much as usual, except that
her waist cloth was longer and more gorgeous. Having been carried about
for some time, her Majesty showed her appreciation of the attentions of
her subjects by distributing gifts. First she threw a small chicken,
which was eagerly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"
name="pb138">138</a>]</span>scrambled for and torn to pieces by the
young men anxious to obtain it, next followed a piece of white cotton
wool, which no one would pick up, and then some red thread, which was
scrambled for eagerly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May 15th.&mdash;This morning a mithan was
sacrificed. The animal was tied by the head to one of the sacrificial
posts, on which his skull was to be placed later on. The chief then
came out with a spear in one hand, a gourd of rice beer in the other.
The puithiam, or sorcerer, accompanied him, also carrying a gourd of
beer. The pair took up their stand just behind the mithan, and the
puithiam began mumbling what I was told were prayers for the prosperity
of the village. The prayers were interrupted by the chief and the
sorcerer taking mouthfuls of beer and blowing them over the mithan.
When the prayers were finished, they anointed the animal with the
remains of the liquor, and the chief then gave it a slight stab behind
the shoulder, and disappeared into his house. The mithan was then
thrown on its side and killed by driving a sharp bamboo spear into its
heart. The animal was then cut up. Later on another was killed, without
any special ceremony, and the flesh of both cooked in the street. Later
on there was a dance. Three men arrayed in fine cloths, with smart
turbans, came up the main street, crossing from side to side. With
bodies bent forward and arms extended, they took two steps forward,
then whirled round once, beat time twice with the right foot, two
steps, whirled round again, beat time twice with the left foot, and so
on, keeping time with the royal band, consisting of a gong, a tom-tom,
and a bamboo tube, used as a drum. The dancers, having been well
regaled with beer, proceeded to dance each a pas seul of a decidedly
indecent nature. The chief was prohibited from crossing running water
for a month after this sacrifice had been performed.&rdquo; After this
feast there is five days&rsquo; &ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; for the whole
community, and during this no flesh may be brought into the village.
The skull of the mithan is kept on the post in front of the
chief&rsquo;s house for a month, during which time he may not cross
water or converse with strangers. On the expiry of a month a pig and a
fowl are sacrificed and the skull is then removed to the front
verandah.</p>
<p class="par">The only difference in the ceremonies connected with
childbirth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>is that the Ui-ha-awr sacrifice is only
performed if the child&rsquo;s hair has a reddish tinge and the whites
of its eyes turn yellowish.</p>
<p class="par">The Sakhua sacrifices are very elaborate, and consist of
a series commencing with the Vok-rial, which is necessary when a new
house has been completed. A sow is killed at the head of the
parents&rsquo; sleeping place, and whatever portions of the flesh are
not at once consumed are placed beneath it till the next day. The house
during this time is &ldquo;sherh.&rdquo; No one may enter it, and the
occupants must not speak to strangers nor enter the forge. Later on a
boar is killed in the front verandah, and the heart, liver, and
entrails, known as &ldquo;kawrawl,&rdquo; are placed under the
parents&rsquo; sleeping place for five days, and are eaten by the
parents, the father sitting with his back to the partition wall and the
mother facing him. During these five days a hrilh as above is observed.
This sacrifice is called &ldquo;Vok-pa&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;Boar&rdquo;&mdash;and is followed by the
&ldquo;Hnuaipui&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Great
Beneath&rdquo;&mdash;a full-grown sow being killed under the house, and
its head and sherh buried at the foot of one of the main posts. The
flesh is cooked beneath the house, but eaten in it. A three days&rsquo;
hrilh follows. The series concludes with
&ldquo;Hnuaite&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Lesser
Beneath&rdquo;&mdash;which is similar to the former, but a young sow is
killed.</p>
<p class="par">These sacrifices are performed as the necessary animals
become available.</p>
<p class="par">A dead Fanai is buried in the usual Lushai way, but no
rice is placed in the grave. An offering of maize, however, is
suspended above it. It may be noted that in the Zahao country rice is
not cultivated, the staple crop being maize. The Fanai do not kill
tigers, giving as the reason that a former ancestor of theirs lost his
way, and was conducted back to his village by a tiger, which kindly
allowed him to hold its tail.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">The R&#257;lte.</span> This
clan is found scattered in the Lushai villages to the north of Aijal,
in which neighbourhood there are also one or two villages under
R&#257;lte chiefs. I have already&mdash;in <a href="#ch1.5.1">Part I.,
Chapter V, para. 1</a>&mdash;given the legend regarding the repeopling
of the world and the closing of the exit from the Chhinglung owing to
the loquacity of the pair of R&#257;lte. The names of these mythical
ancestors were Hehua and Leplupi. Their two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>sons
were Kheltea and Siakenga, who quarrelled over the distribution of
their father&rsquo;s goods, which Kheltea, the younger, had taken, thus
conforming to Lushei custom, and set up separate villages, and from
them have sprung the two eponymous families into which the R&#257;lte
clan is divided. The Khelte have always occupied a predominant
position, and all the chiefs belong to this family. Lutmanga,
Kheltea&rsquo;s youngest son, is said to have made the first cloth from
the fibre of the Khawpui creeper. He collected a community at Khuazim,
a hill north of Champhai, and from him all the R&#257;lte chiefs are
descended. In the early years of the nineteenth century the R&#257;lte
villages were near Champhai, and Mangkhaia, a R&#257;lte chief of
importance, was captured by some Chuango, a family of the Lushei clan,
then living at Bualte, above Tuibual (known to the Chin Hills officers
as Dipwell). He was ransomed by his relatives, but Vanpuia, the Pachuao
chief, not receiving a share, ambushed Mangkhaia on his way home and
killed him. According to another account Mangkhaia filed through his
fetters with a file given to him in a roll of smoked meat, and was
killed as he was escaping. His memorial stone is famous throughout the
Hills, and stands at the southern extremity of Champhai. Mangthawnga,
father of Mangkhaia, joined Khawzahuala the Zadeng, then living at
Tualbung, but, being ill-treated, the R&#257;lte joined Sutmanga, a
Thado chief then at Phaileng, who treated them well. Thawnglura, son of
Mangthawnga, showed his gratitude to Sutmanga by assisting the Sailo
chief Lallianvunga, father of Gnura (Mullah)&mdash;whose village
Colonel Lister burnt in 1850&mdash;to attack him. Sutmanga then fled
northwards. It is satisfactory to know that Thawnglura&rsquo;s
treachery was rewarded by the enslavement of his clan, who till our
occupation of the Hills remained vassals of the Sailos. The R&#257;lte
are very quarrelsome, and have to a great extent resisted absorption
into the Lushais. In some Sailo chiefs&rsquo; villages there are so
many R&#257;lte that the chief himself speaks their dialect, and though
Lushai is understood little else but R&#257;lte is heard in the
village.</p>
<p class="par">The R&#257;lte are linguistically connected with the
Thado, and, like the Thado, they used not to build zawlbuks, but are
now following Lushai custom in this respect.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd24e6099width" id="p140"><img src="images/p140.jpg"

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Khelte family has ten and the Siakeng family eleven
branches. To the various sums paid to the relatives of the bride among
the Lushais, the Ralte add &ldquo;dawngbul&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dawngler&rdquo;&mdash;sums of Rs. 3/- paid to her male and
female paternal first cousins.</p>
<p class="par">The two families have slightly different customs as
regard sacrifices. The Khelte sacrifice to Sakhua is a boar, which is
killed at the head of the parents&rsquo; sleeping place and then cooked
on the hearth. The skull is hung on the back wall of the house in a
basket with six pieces of the liver and three of the skin. The chant is
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You whom our grandmothers worshipped!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You whom our grandfathers worshipped!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You of our birthplace!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You of our place of origin!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You who made the Khelte!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. You who made the Tuangphei!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. In what we have done wrong!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. In what we have sung amiss!</p>
<p class="line">Ah&mdash;h. Make it right!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The Siakeng, after killing the boar as the Khelte
do, entertain those of their own branch, but before the flesh is eaten
it is divided into three portions, which are placed for a short time
successively on the floor, on the sleeping-place, and on the shelf over
the hearth, being thus offered to the spirits of the house, the couch,
and the hearth.</p>
<p class="par">Of the Naohri sacrifices the Khelte only perform the
Hmar-phir, which they call &ldquo;Thangsang&rdquo; and the Ui-ha-awr,
while the Siakeng perform the Vawkte-luilam, called by them
&ldquo;Chhim-hal,&rdquo; and the Ui-ha-awr.</p>
<p class="par">They have adopted most of the Thangchhuah festivals, but
not the Mi-thi-rawp-lam. When a mithan is killed it is not speared as
among the Lushais, but killed by a blow on the forehead. The skull is
placed at the foot of the partition wall for three days, and on the
fourth it is taken out and placed at the foot of the memorial post.
Some ginger, beans, and salt are placed on a dish and an old man takes
the skull, and all dance round the post three times to the beating of
drums and gongs. Then ginger is thrown three times on to the skull,
after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>which the house-owner&rsquo;s wife pierces the
skull with a spear, but if she be pregnant this must be done by a man.
The skull is then placed on one of the posts of the platform in front
of the house till the Khuangchoi has been performed.</p>
<p class="par">On the occasion of the first death occurring in a new
village a spot is selected beyond the line of houses, and the corpse is
buried there, subsequent interments being made close at hand. It is
considered &ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; to bury in a village. A well-to-do
Khelte after death is dressed in his best, and seated with his back to
the partition wall while his relatives and friends drink and dance
before him. A bier is made by elderly persons, and on this the corpse
is placed in a sitting position, with his weapons in his hands, and
three times lifted by old men and women up to the rafters, while drums
and gongs are beaten, after which the body is carried out to the
graveyard.</p>
<p class="par">The birth customs generally resemble those of the
Lushais.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">The Paihte or Vuite.</span>
This is a clan of some importance still. There are eleven Vuite
villages, numbering 877 houses, in the south-west corner of the Manipur
State and two in the adjoining portions of the Lushai Hills. When we
occupied the Hills we found many of this clan living in a species of
slavery in the villages of important Sailo chiefs. They have mostly
rejoined their clansmen, from whom they had been carried off as
prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="par">The clan is generally known to the Lushais as Paihte,
but Vuite is the term more commonly used by its members and in Manipur.
Vuitea and Paihtea were the sons <span class="corr" id="xd24e6147"
title="Source: of of">of</span> Lamleia, who was hatched out of an egg.
There were two eggs, and Aichhana, a Thado, tasted one, and, finding it
bitter, threw it away and put the other among the rice in the bin, and
in due time Lamleia was hatched out, and the present Vuite chiefs claim
to be his direct descendants, enumerating seventeen generations. The
Thado version of this story is that Dongel, Thado&rsquo;s elder
brother, had incestuous intercourse with his elder sister, and on a
male child being born their mother was so ashamed that she hid the
child in a hollow tree, thinking it would die, but when she found it
was alive after several days she brought it into the house and
concealed it in the paddy bin, and produced it a few days later, saying
that she had found two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>big eggs in a hollow tree and had
tasted one and had found it very bitter. The second she had placed in
the paddy, where it had been hatched by the sun&rsquo;s rays. Hence the
child was called Gwite, from &ldquo;ni-gwi,&rdquo; the Thado for a ray
of sunshine. The Vuite, of course, do not admit this tale to be true,
but my informant tells me that in his father&rsquo;s time, when the
Dongel and Vuite lived near to each other, the former paid
&ldquo;sathing&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a portion of each animal
killed&mdash;to the latter, in recognition that the Vuite were
descended from the elder sister of their ancestor. The Vuite, however,
always tried to avoid accepting such presents, and when the Dongel
moved away the custom died out. The first Vuite village is said to have
been at Chimnuai, near to Tiddim. The name of this site comes first in
the Vuite Sakhua chant which I obtained in the Lushai Hills. Being
attacked by the Sokte and Falam clans, they joined the Thangur chiefs,
but were ill-treated and fled to the neighbourhood in which they now
live, and waged war with their oppressors till the establishment of our
rule. They at one time approached the Manipur plain and in 1870, under
Sumk&#257;m, they raided a Manipuri village, to avenge a charge of
being wizards. They appear to be closely connected with the Malun,
Sokte, and Kamhau clans of the adjoining Chin Hills, and Dr. Grierson
places them linguistically in the same group as these clans and the
Thado. In their dress and habitations they resemble the Lushais, but
the place of the zawlbuk is taken by the front verandah of the houses
of certain persons of importance, in which are long sleeping bunks in
which half a dozen or more young men pass the night. The young fellows
help their host in his house-building and cultivation, and once a year
he gives them a feast of a pig. This custom prevails in most of the
non-Lushei clans, and also among the Kabui Nagas in the Manipur
Hills.</p>
<p class="par">The women do not wear the huge ivory earrings of the
Lushai but cornelians or short lead bars.</p>
<p class="par">The general constitution of the clan and the village is
very similar to that of the Lushais. As regards marriage they are
monogamists, in this particular forming a very remarkable exception to
all their cognates. The marriages of paternal first cousins are
allowed&mdash;in fact, among chiefs they are the rule. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>The
parents of a young man who desires to marry a girl go to her house with
an offering of zu, and if this is accepted the girl is at once taken to
their house, but the bridegroom continues for two or three months to
sleep with his bachelor friends. The marriage is not considered final
nor is any payment made till a child is born, and if this does not
occur within three years the couple separate, but on the birth of a
child the full price agreed on must be paid up and divorce is not
countenanced. On my enquiring what would happen in case the lady
subsequently proved fickle, my informant smiled in a superior manner
and said that such behaviour was unknown among his people. The Vuite
object to giving their girls to the Lushais on account of the tendency
of Lushai husbands to discard their wives on the slightest excuse.</p>
<p class="par">Although the Vuite do not maintain that before marriage
their girls are invariably chaste, yet one who errs is looked down on,
and in consequence abortion and infanticide are said to be common.
&ldquo;Sawnman&rdquo; at Rs. 23/- is demanded from the seducer.</p>
<p class="par">As among most non-Lushei tribes, the eldest son
inherits. The punishments for offences are similar to those among the
Lushais, but the Vuite assert that the crime of sodomy is unknown among
them. Murder can be atoned for by the payment of seven mithan to the
heir of the murdered man, and accidental homicide by that of one mithan
and a gun. In the days when war was common they used to ambush their
enemies more than was usual among the Lushais, but they never went
head-hunting simply for honour and glory. As regards &ldquo;boi,&rdquo;
they follow Lushai customs closely.</p>
<p class="par">Pathian is acknowledged, and in general their religious
beliefs resemble those of the Lushais, but they have no idea of a
separate abode for the spirits of warriors. They believe that departed
spirits have two or more lives in the land beyond the grave.</p>
<p class="par">For their Sakhua sacrifice a boar is killed on the front
verandah and cooked within the house. The skin of the head, the
testicles, heart, snout, and liver are placed on a bamboo over the
verandah, which must be freshly thatched.</p>
<p class="par">Immediately after birth the child is washed, and a fowl
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>killed, and its feathers are worn round the
necks of the mother and infant. The mother may go out of the house, but
for four days after the birth both parents abstain from all work. On
occasion of the naming two or three pigs if available should be killed
and much zu drunk. The Kh&#257;l sacrifices, with the exception of
Uihring, are not performed, but most of the other sacrifices are
made.</p>
<p class="par">The custom of paying &ldquo;lukawng&rdquo; on the death
of a person is unknown, and the funeral ceremonies generally are very
unlike those of the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">After death the corpse is placed on a platform and fires
are lit round it, and young men and maidens sleep near it. The skin is
hardened and preserved by being rubbed with some greasy preparation.
The body is dressed in the best cloths available, and a chaplet of the
tail feathers of the hornbill is placed on its head. During the daytime
the corpse is kept in the house, but in the evening it is brought out
and seated on the verandah while the villagers dance and sing round it
and drink zu, pouring it also into the mouth of the corpse. This
disgusting performance goes on for a month or more according to the
social position of the deceased. The corpses of those who have attained
Thangchhuah honours are kept for a year, at least, in a special shed
encased in a tree trunk. Before burial the corpse is carried round the
village. In case of a violent death, which does not as among the
Lushais include deaths in childbirth, the corpse is placed in the forge
and the puithiam sacrifices a fowl, after which the usual ceremonies
take place. The Kut festivals are not observed, but after harvest the
owners of houses in which young men lodge kill one or two pigs. The
honour of Thangchhuah is obtained by giving the following
feasts:&mdash;(1) Buh ai, one mithan being killed; (2) She-shun, one
mithan being killed; (3) Chawn, three mithan and two pigs being killed.
No other feasts are given and windows may be made by anyone. Most of
the superstitions common among the Lushais are believed, but gibbons
are freely killed. The Vuite are very much afraid of witchcraft, but
deny all knowledge of it. When a new site for a house has to be chosen
an egg is taken and one end is removed. It is then propped up on three
small stones and a fire is lit under it. If the contents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>boil
over towards the person consulting the omen the site is rejected as
unlucky.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">The R&#257;ngte.</span> This is
a small clan which, after various vicissitudes, has settled down in
thirteen hamlets, containing 372 houses, under their own chiefs in the
south-western hills of Manipur. They claim connection with the Thados,
but resemble the Lushais in many respects, which no doubt is due to
their sojourn among them. They also claim relationship with the
Vaiphei. They say that their original villages were on two hills called
Phaizang and Koku, whence they were ejected by the Chins and took
refuge with Poiboi, one of the Sailo chiefs who opposed us in 1871,
whence they migrated northwards to their present place of abode. Their
language shows that their claim to being allied to the Thado is not
without foundation. The clan is divided into eleven eponymous families,
named after Thanghlum and his ten sons, Thanghlum being supposed to be
the son of R&#257;ngte. The constitution of the villages is practically
the same as that of the Lushais, except that there are no zawlbuks. The
young unmarried men sleep in the house of the girl they like best. An
attractive young lady may have several admirers sleeping in her house,
and they will continue to sleep there until she expresses a preference
for one of them. Marriage is not very strictly limited, but matches
with another member of the clan or with some member of one of the Thado
families are most usual. The price of a
wife&mdash;&ldquo;manpui&rdquo;&mdash;is one blue cloth, one mattress,
and three mithan, which is paid to the nearest male relative to the
bride on the father&rsquo;s side, but besides this the bride&rsquo;s
paternal uncle receives one mithan, which is termed
&ldquo;mankang.&rdquo; If there be three brothers, A, B, and C, B will
take the mankang of A&rsquo;s daughters, C that of B&rsquo;s, and A
that of C&rsquo;s. Should a man have no brothers some near relative
will take his daughter&rsquo;s mankang. The eldest son inherits
everything, and is looked on as the head of the family. He receives the
&ldquo;manpui&rdquo; of all the females, and in his verandah are hung
all the trophies of the chase obtained by his brothers and their
children, but on the death of one of these brothers the connection
ceases, and the deceased&rsquo;s eldest son inherits his property and
is looked on as the head of the family by his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>younger brothers. Like the Vuite, the
R&#257;ngte claim that sodomy is unknown among them. In their religious
beliefs they employ the nomenclature of the Thados, though there is a
little variation. The place of Pupawla on the road to Mi-thi-khua is
taken by an old woman, named Kul-lo-nu, who is evidently the same as
the Thado Kulsamnu, who troubles all except the Thangchhuah. Thlan-ropa
is known as &ldquo;D&#257;p&#257;,&rdquo; but the legends regarding him
are similar to those told by the Lushais.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On the birth of a female child, zu is drunk, but should
the child be a son, a pig and a fowl have to be killed, and three days
later the puithiam comes and sprinkles the mother with water, muttering
charms as he does so, after which ceremony she can go out. Immediately
after a death everyone present seizes the nearest weapon and slashes
wildly at the walls, posts, shelves, and partitions, shouting,
&ldquo;You have killed him! We will cut you limb from limb, whoever you
may be.&rdquo; The young men then go out in search of wild birds and
beasts, the bodies of which are hung on posts round the grave. The
corpse is adorned with the head-dress of hornbill&rsquo;s feathers, as
among the Vuite and most of the Old Kuki clans. The corpses of ordinary
persons are buried without much ceremony close to the house, but the
Thangchhuah are carried round the village, as among the Khawtlang, and
then enclosed in hollow tree trunks, and kept for periods varying from
two months to a year in special sheds, with fires smouldering beneath
them, after which the bones are buried. In this it will be noticed that
the R&#257;ngte custom is a composite of Lushei, Vuite, and
Khawtlang.</p>
<p class="par">Lukawng is only paid if the deceased has been a great
hunter or warrior. In their marriage ceremonies the R&#257;ngte differ
but little from the Lushais. The &ldquo;Kh&#257;l&rdquo; sacrifices are
omitted, but most of the others are performed.</p>
<p class="par">Thangchhuah honours are attained by giving only two
feasts&mdash;the &ldquo;Chong,&rdquo; at which a hen has to be
sacrificed and two pigs and a mithan killed, and the
&ldquo;Mai-thuk-kai,&rdquo; at which two mithan, three pigs, and a hen
have to be killed. The guests hold hands and form a circle round the
house of the giver of the feast, who has to anoint the head of each of
them with pig&rsquo;s fat. The Buh-Ai is unknown, but the Ai of wild
animals is performed as among the Lushais. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE OLD KUKI CLANS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The term Old Kukis has long been applied to the
clans which suddenly appeared in Cachar about 1800, the cause of which
eruption I have explained when dealing with the history of the Lushais,
but Dr. Grierson in the <i>Linguistic Survey</i> has included in this
group a number of clans which had long been settled in Manipur
territory, and my enquiries all go to prove the correctness of this
classification. It appears practically certain that the ancestors of
the Old Kukis and the Lushais were related and lived very close
together somewhere in the centre of the hills on the banks of the Tyao
and Manipur rivers. The Old Kuki clans of Manipur seem to have been the
first to move, as records of their appearance there are found in the
Manipur chronicle as early as the sixteenth century, and, though the
chronology of the chronicle is not beyond suspicion, I think this may
be taken as proof that these clans appeared in Manipur a good deal
earlier than their relations the Bete and Rhangkhol entered Cachar.
What the cause of this move was it is impossible to say. Probably
quarrels with their neighbours, coupled with a desire for better land,
combined to cause the exodus, and the movement, once started, had to
continue till the clans found a haven of rest in Manipur, as their
relatives did centuries later in British territory; for they were
small, weak communities, at the mercy of the stronger clans, through
whose lands they passed.</p>
<p class="par">All these Old Kuki clans are organised far more
democratically than the Lushais or Thados. Lieut. Stewart in his Notes
on Northern Cachar says:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no regular system of
government among the Old Kukis and they have no hereditary chiefs as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>among the New ones. A headman called the
&lsquo;ghalim&rsquo; is appointed by themselves over each village, but
he is much more a priest than a potentate, and his temporal power is
much limited. Internal administration among them always takes a
provisional form. When any party considers himself aggrieved, he makes
an appeal to the elders, or the most powerful householders in the
village, by inviting them to dinner and plying them with victuals and
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Among the clans which settled early in Manipur, each
village has been provided with a number of officials with high-sounding
titles and little power, in imitation of the Manipur system. Among
those who have settled in British territory the ghalim has been
transformed into the &ldquo;gaonbura&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, head of
the village&mdash;and has acquired a certain amount of authority,
whilst among the Khawtlang and Khawchhak clans, which after various
vicissitudes, including a more or less lengthy sojourn among the
Lushais, recently entered Manipur territory, the ghalim has become a
feeble imitation of a Lushai lal.</p>
<p class="par"><i>The Old Kuki Clans of Manipur.</i></p>
<p class="par">Under this heading I propose dealing with the Aimol,
Anal, Chawte, Chiru, Kolhen, Kom, Lamgang, Purum, Tikhup, and Vaiphei,
who are now found in various parts of the hills bordering the Manipur
valley, and who resemble each other in very many respects. In spite of
this resemblance, the clans, while acknowledging their relationship to
one another, keep entirely apart, living in separate villages and never
intermarrying.</p>
<p class="par">In the Manipur chronicle the Chiru and Anal are
mentioned as early as the middle of the sixteenth century, while the
Aimol make their first appearance in 1723. They are said to have come
from Tipperah, but at that time the eastern boundary of Tipperah was
not determined, and the greater part of the present Lushai Hills
district was supposed to be more or less under the control of the Rajah
of that State. A short distance to the east of Aijal there is a village
site called Vai-tui-chhun&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the watering place of the
Vai&mdash;which is said to commemorate a former settlement of the
Vaiphei. It seems probable, therefore, that the Aimol and Vaiphei left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>their former homes in consequence of the forward
movement of the Lusheis. The remaining tribes all claim to have come
from various places to the south of Manipur&mdash;the Anal from the
Haubi peak, the Chiru from &ldquo;the Hranglal hill far away in the
south,&rdquo; the Kom from the Sakripung hill in the Chin Hills; the
other clans can give no nearer definition of the home of their
forefathers than far away to the south. Like the Lushais, they all
assert that they are descended from couples who issued out of the
earth, the Chhinglung of the Lushais being replaced by
&ldquo;Khurpui&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the great hole.</p>
<p class="par">The Anal assert that two brothers came out of a cave on
the Haubi peak, and that the elder was the ancestor of the Anals, while
the younger went to the valley of Manipur and became king of the
valley. Another tradition says that the Manipuris, Anals, and Thados
are the descendants of three men, whose father was the son of
Pakh&#257;ngba, the mythical snake-man ancestor of the Manipuri royal
family, who, taking the form of an attractive youth, overcame the
scruples of a maiden engaged in weeding her jhum (compare
Hodson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meitheis,&rdquo; page 12). These legends were
probably invented after the clans had come in contact in order to
account for the resemblances between them. The Chiru claim to be
descended from Rezar, the son of Chongthu, the ancestor of the clan of
that name still found in the Lushai Hills, whose name also appears in
the Thado pedigree. The Lamgang tell the following tale:&mdash;On the
Kangmang hill, away to the south, there is a cave. Out of this came a
man and a woman, and were eaten up by a tiger which was watching. A god
who had two horns, seeing this horrible sight, came out and drove away
the tiger, and so the next couple to emerge escaped and became the
ancestors of the Lamgang. The Purum claim to be descended from Tonring
and Tonshu, who issued from the earth. It is said that &ldquo;Pu
rum&rdquo; means &ldquo;hide from tiger,&rdquo; which connects them
closely with the Lamgang legend. The Kolhen&rsquo;s ancestors were a
man and woman who sprang out of Khurpui provided with a basket and a
spear, and lived at Talching, and had a son and daughter called Nairung
and Shaithatpal, the direct descendants of whom are said still to be
found among the Kolhen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Chawte told me the tale of the peopling of the world
out of a hole in the ground, adding the graphic touch that an
inquisitive monkey lifted up a stone which lay over the opening, and
thus allowed their ancestors to emerge.</p>
<p class="par">It is not quite clear whether these clans are eponymous.
The Chiru say that their clan is named after an ancestor, but can give
no pedigree. The Aimol say that there is no general name for the
various families, and that Aimol is the name of the village site. It is
probably Ai-mual. &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; is the Lushai name of a berry and
also means crab, and appears in Ai-zawl or Aijal. &ldquo;Mual&rdquo; is
the Lushai for a spur of a hill. It is a very common, in fact almost a
universal, custom to call a new village site, if it has no recognised
name, after the site of the old village, and probably the original
Aimual would be found in the centre of the Lushai Hills.</p>
<p class="par">All these clans have come much under Manipuri influence,
and the Chiru, Aimol, Kolhen, Chawte, Purum, and Tikhup have abandoned
the ancestral architecture, and now live in houses built on raised
earthen plinths like the Manipuris.</p>
<p class="par">The remaining clans still adhere to the ancient style,
their houses being raised some four or five feet off the ground on
posts. The walls are of planks, and the roofs of thatching grass; they
remind one much of the Falam houses. Round each village are clustered
the granaries&mdash;small houses raised well off the ground and placed
sufficiently far from the dwelling houses to make them fairly safe from
fire. Where the houses are raised sufficiently pigs and poultry live
under them; but cattle sheds are common, most of these clans having
learnt the value of cows and buffaloes from the Manipuris. The handsome
breed of goats so common in a Lushai village is seldom if ever seen,
but animals of an inferior sort are generally kept.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru, Kom, and Tikhup still build zawlbuks. No
woman is allowed to enter these buildings, which, besides being the
dormitories of the unmarried men, are used for drinking bouts. They are
externally very like those built by the Lushais, but have several
fireplaces evidently used for cooking, and the general hearth in the
centre is absent. Some of the clans which do not now build zawlbuks say
that they believe their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>forefathers did so. In the absence
of the zawlbuk the young men generally sleep in the houses of
well-to-do villagers, but among the Purum I am told that &ldquo;if a
man has one unmarried son and one unmarried daughter, the boy goes to
sleep at the house of a man who has an unmarried daughter; though they
sleep in this way they are very careful about their characters.&rdquo;
Have we here stumbled on the real origin of the &ldquo;young
men&rsquo;s house&rdquo;&mdash;a desire to prevent incest? The young
women also have houses in which they gather at time of festivals, but
they do not sleep there.</p>
<p class="par">The rotchem, the Lushai mouth-organ, is found among all
these clans, but rather smaller and ornamented with fowls&rsquo;
feathers. The Anal make a speciality of long bamboo trumpets, on which
they perform with considerable skill, producing sounds
indistinguishable from those of a bugle. The trumpets are from four to
five feet long, and have bell-shaped mouths made of gourds.</p>
<p class="par">Most of these clans have adopted various dances from the
Manipuris, their own dancing being of the monotonous nature common to
the Lushais and Kukis.</p>
<p class="par">In dress and method of wearing the hair Manipuri
influence is also noticeable, the men generally wearing coats and
loin-cloths and turbans. The women are more conservative and adhere to
the short petticoat. The hair is generally worn very much in the Lushai
fashion, but the Chiru men are an exception to this. They part their
hair in the middle and brush it down straight, and trim it level with
the bottom of the ears. They bind a narrow fillet of cane round the
head slightly above the eyes. The Kolhen women gather the hair into two
heavy rolls, which hang down in front of each ear. The Tikhup maidens
have adopted the Manipuri method of dressing the hair.</p>
<p class="par">The ivory discs worn in the ears by Lushai women are not
found, but metal rings are worn in a similar manner by both sexes.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Manipuris have instituted in each village a number
of posts with high-sounding titles, similar to those in use among
themselves, but traces of the older organisation are to be found. Thus
the Aimol recognise a man called Thompa, of the Chomgom family, as the
head of the clan, but he has no power <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>and receives nothing,
while in each village are four officials who receive a portion of every
animal killed in the chase. They are called &ldquo;kamzakhoi,&rdquo;
&ldquo;zakachhunga,&rdquo; &ldquo;zupalba,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pakanglakpa.&rdquo; The last two titles have a distinctly
Manipuri sound about them. The usual titles found are
&ldquo;khul-lakpa&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, chief of the
village&mdash;&ldquo;lup-lakpa,&rdquo; &ldquo;zupalba,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Methei lumbu&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> Manipuri
interpreter&mdash;but there are others. The khul-lakpa and lup-lakpa
are hereditary posts. Among the Lamgang there are seven such hereditary
posts. Among the Chiru the khul-lakpa, besides receiving a portion of
each animal killed, also gets his house built for nothing, which brings
him very near to the Lushai &ldquo;l&#257;l.&rdquo; Among the Kolhen
the khul-lakpa&rsquo;s and lup-lakpa&rsquo;s posts are not hereditary,
but on the death of either his successor must be chosen out of the same
family, but his sons are ineligible. The new official has to give a
feast, killing a pig, which is eaten by the whole community, and the
young men and maidens make merry with dance and song. It seems probable
that in this may be some idea of averting the evil effects of a breach
of the generally accepted custom.</p>
<p class="par">The puithiam is known as &ldquo;thempu,&rdquo;
&ldquo;khulpu,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bulropa,&rdquo; and both he and the
blacksmith are sometimes rewarded, receiving a day&rsquo;s labour from
each householder they serve, instead of a donation of rice.</p>
<p class="par">The Lushai system of &ldquo;boi&rdquo; is generally
unknown, which is only natural in such democratic communities.</p>
<p class="par">The following animals are not generally
eaten&mdash;tigers, snakes, cats, crows, or kites; and among the
Lamgang the rat is also considered unfit for food.</p>
<p class="par">Each clan is divided into eponymous families and
generally marriage is restricted to the clan, but alliances within the
family are prohibited. The Aimol clan is divided into five
families&mdash;Chongom, Laita or Mangte, Khoichung or Leivon, Lanu, and
Chaita. Marriage is unrestricted, but it is unusual for either sex to
marry without the clan. The Kolhen are divided into twelve exogamous
families divided into two groups, which are also exogamous (<i>v.</i>
below, under Festivals, page 167), but marriage outside the clan is
prohibited. Among the Anal, Purum, and Lamgang marriages must be made
within the clan, but not within the family. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Tikhup clan, which only numbers some twenty
households, is not sub-divided, but marriage is endogamous. The union
of first cousins, either paternal or maternal, is prohibited. The
elders of the clan attributed the steady decline in their numbers to
this custom of endogamy.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru and Chawte customs are alike; not only is a
young man&rsquo;s choice limited to some family in the clan other than
his own, but the actual families from which he may choose his bride are
strictly fixed.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Chiru&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>A Danla lad may marry a Dingthoi or Shangpa girl.</li>
<li>A Dingthoi lad may marry a Chongdur or Danla girl.</li>
<li>A Rezar lad may marry a Danla girl.</li>
<li>A Shangpa lad may marry a Dingthoi or Danla girl.</li>
<li>A Chongdur lad may marry a Danla girl.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Danla is the family from which the khul-lakpa must be
taken, and Rezar has already been noticed as the son of Chongthu, from
whom the Chiru claim descent.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Chawte&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>A Marem lad may only marry a Makhan girl.</li>
<li>A Makhan lad may only marry an Irung girl.</li>
<li>A Kiang lad may only marry a Makhan or Marem girl.</li>
<li>An Irung lad may only marry a Marem, Thao, or Kiang girl.</li>
<li>A Thao lad may only marry a Makhan girl.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Among the Aimol, Anal, Chiru, and Purum, a young man has
to serve his future wife&rsquo;s father for three years, during which
he works as if he were a son of the house. During this period he has
free access to the girl, though among the Chiru he continues to sleep
among the bachelors. Should the girl become enceinte the marriage
ceremony must be performed, and the price paid. Among the Aimol the
bride&rsquo;s eldest brother gets Rs. 6/- and each of the others one
rupee less than his immediate senior. The paternal and maternal uncles
receive Rs. 2/- each; the aunt and the elder sister also receive Rs.
1/- each as &ldquo;niman&rdquo; and &ldquo;nao-puan-puk-man,&rdquo; as
among the Lushais. Among the Anal and the Purum, the price must not be
less <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>than a pig and a piece of iron a cubit in
length, but the girl&rsquo;s relatives try to get as much more as they
can. The bridegroom has also to feast the family of his bride three
times on pork, fowls, and rice, washed down, of course, with plenty of
zu. The Chiru girls are only valued at one gong.</p>
<p class="par">Among the other clans, marriage is by simple purchase. A
Chawte maiden can be obtained for a spear, a dao, and a fowl, the
payment being sealed by the consumption of much zu. The price of a
Kolhen girl is a gong and Rs. 7/- to her mother, and Rs. 7/- each to
the elder and younger brother and the maternal uncle. This is most
curious, for the father is entirely omitted. Can it be a survival of
mother right? The Kom girls are valued very high, the father receiving
one gong, four buffaloes, fifteen cloths, a hoe, and a spear, the aunt
taking a black and white cloth. A Lamgamg bridegroom has to pay his
father-in-law three pigs or buffaloes or cows, one string of conch
shell beads, one lead bracelet, and one black or blue petticoat. A
Tikhup father expects a gong, ten hoes, one dao, and one spear; the
maternal grandfather also demands Rs. 7/-.</p>
<p class="par">The price of a Vaiphei girl varies between two and ten
mithan. To a certain extent the price of the girls may be taken as an
indication of the relative importance of the clan. Marriage by
servitude is not found among either the Lushai or the Thado clans; its
appearance among the Old Kukis is therefore curious, for as a rule the
customs of a clan will be found to resemble those of one or the other
of these two main divisions of the Kuki-Lushai race.</p>
<p class="par">Polygamy is, as a rule, permitted. Among the Anal and
Lamgang, the first wife is entitled to the company of her husband for
five nights, the second for four, and the third for three. It is not
quite clear how a second marriage by servitude can be carried out, and
probably the rules are modified in such cases. Polygamy is but little
practised on account of the expense; among the Kolhen it is
prohibited.</p>
<p class="par">In most of these clans the Thado rule of inheritance is
followed&mdash;viz., the eldest son takes all his father&rsquo;s
property, the younger sons only getting what the heir chooses to give
them. Among the Anal and Purum, and probably also the Lamgang, the sons
of the deceased divide the property, but the youngest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>son
takes the house and supports the widow, thus approximating to the
Lushai custom.</p>
<p class="par">In most clans the father of an illegitimate child is
fined. Among the Chiru the fine is a pig, a mithan, and two gongs.</p>
<p class="par">Divorce is generally easily obtained. Among the Aimol,
if either party repents of the bargain, the payment of a cloth and
three pots of zu annuls the contract. Among the Tikhup the cost of
divorce is a mithan and a gong. The Anal and most of the other clans
insist on the question being submitted to the village officials, who
receive fees according to their position, and settle what compensation,
if any, shall be paid to either party. As a rule it is very difficult
for a woman to obtain a divorce unless her husband agrees, even though
he may be extremely unfaithful and brutal. Among the Anal she must give
a feast to the village or pay her husband Rs. 50/-.</p>
<p class="par">In case of a wife being led astray the injured husband
recovers her price or an equivalent amount (among the Tikhup twice the
price) from her seducer. In this the Thado custom is followed, which is
more just than that of the Lushais, but not so conducive to morality,
for among the the Lushais the whole of the woman&rsquo;s family are
interested in keeping her from committing herself and are loud in
condemnation should she do so, as they have to refund the various sums
they have received on her behalf, whereas among the Thado the seducer
simply pays up the price and takes the woman, who is thought very
little the worse of&mdash;in fact, among the clans which follow this
apparently more just custom, women hold a far lower position, being
traded from one to another, unless they have influential male relatives
who take an interest in them.</p>
<p class="par">All these clans have been given definite sites in
Manipur and have practically abandoned the migratory habits of their
forefathers, and therefore the idea of property in land, which is
entirely absent in the case of the Lushais, is fast springing up. Many
villages are moving nearer to the plain in order that the people may
take leases from the State of land in the valley and carry on plough
cultivation, but they also do a certain amount of jhuming, and
proprietary rights in jhum lands are recognised.</p>
<p class="par">The punishment for theft is arranged much on the Lushai
system of the theft of certain articles having a fixed fine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>attached to it. This is generally a pig, two
jars of zu, and a brass plate. Among the Chiru the whole fine is
consumed by the people of the village, the thief also getting his
share. The Kolhen punishment is a fine of Rs. 28/-, a pig, and two jars
of zu. In case of rice being stolen, the Tikhup custom is that the
village officials at once kill and eat the pig of the thief and then
make him pay a mithan as compensation to the complainant. Thefts of
minor articles are generally punished by the thief providing a pig and
zu for the entertainment of his judges. Manslaughter is punished by the
payment of compensation, the amount varying considerably. The Anal
demand a mithan and a gong, the Chiru a mithan and a cloth, the Kolhen
three mithan, a brass pot, a pig, and two pots of zu, the Lamgang four
gongs, ten jars of zu, and a big pig. Petty assaults are punished by
fines of pigs and zu. A false charge is often punished by a fine of zu.
Most of these clans declare that sodomy is unknown among them, the very
notion appearing to them highly absurd.</p>
<p class="par">All disputes and accusations are disposed of by the
village officials, who meet sometimes in the house of the khul-lakpa
and sometimes at a special spot outside the village where stone seats
have been prepared.</p>
<p class="par">Since the settlement of these clans in Manipur territory
all raiding and fighting has been stopped, so that they have
practically forgotten what were the habits of their forefathers in
these respects, but the Kom declare that in the good old days the young
Kom warriors went off on head-hunting expeditions, and if successful
adorned the village gate with the trophies of their prowess; and there
is no reason to doubt that, in spite of their present peaceable
behaviour, the previous history of these clans was not less full of
raids and counter-raids than that of their neighbours.</p>
<p class="par">The general religious beliefs of these clans show a
great resemblance to each other and also to that of the Lushais.
Pathian is universally recognised as the creator who lives in the sky,
though the name is slightly different, appearing as Pathel among the
Anal and Kolhen, and Patheng among the Kom. Mi-thi-khua is generally
known as the place of departed spirits, but the Chiru and Tikhup have
no idea of a place of greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>comfort for the spirits of
warriors, though the Chiru believe that the spirits of those that die
unnatural deaths go to a separate and inferior place, while those of
the other dead go westwards into the sky. The Anal, Kolhen, and Lamgang
believe that, after hovering around the grave for some time, the spirit
is reincarnated in some new-born child, but that an unnatural death
prevents this and the spirit passes away skywards and returns no more.
The belief in a being or beings which trouble the spirits on their way
to Mi-thi-khua, as Pupawla does with his pellet bow, is very general.
The Aimol call him Ramcharipu, and say that he makes the spirits of
all, except &ldquo;Thangchhuah,&rdquo; kill a certain number of lice in
his head. The Vaiphei say that a male and a female being guard the road
and trouble and detain the spirits of those who have not attained the
honours of Thangchhuah. With the exception of the Tikhup, all the clans
believe in demons, which they call by various names and which
correspond exactly with the Huai of the Lushais. The Aimol call these
devils Numeinu, Thanglian Borh, Tuikuachoi. &ldquo;Numeinu&rdquo; means
mother of woman Borh brings to memory the infantile illness called by
that name by the Lushais, while &ldquo;Tuikuachoi&rdquo; is evidently
the Tui-huai. The Aimol and Chiru perform the Daibawl sacrifices in the
same manner as the Lushais. The Chawte sacrifice pigs and fowls in case
of sickness, but the Kh&#257;l sacrifices are quite unknown to any Old
Kuki clans. L&#257;shi is known to the Aimol and Vaiphei. Among the
former the Sakhua sacrifices are performed to this deity, and he is
capable of giving success in the chase<span class="corr" id="xd24e6367"
title="Source: ,">.</span> The Vaiphei place L&#257;shi almost on a par
with Pathian and sacrifice a pig to him every year. Strange to say, he
is supposed to have only one leg. The Sakhua chant of the Vuite
commences with an invocation to all the wild animals to collect.</p>
<p class="par">In nearly every clan there is an annual festival in
honour of the souls of those who have died during the year, but in no
case is the Mi-thi-rawp-l&#257;m or any similar festival included in
the series of Thangchhuah feasts.</p>
<p class="par">The Aimol sacrifice either a pig or a goat to L&#257;shi
as their Sakhua. The Chawte have been much influenced by Manipuris, and
I was first told that the names of their gods were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>Pakh&#257;ngba and Nungchongba, but on a little
further enquiry I found that Pakh&#257;ngba was always called Pathian
when talking among themselves. The other deity is probably the Manipuri
god Nungshaba (&ldquo;The Meitheis,&rdquo; Hodson, page 98).</p>
<p class="par">Above the hamlet was an oval, level space with a low
wall round it. At the eastern end was a small house in which were two
stones. This was the abode of Pakh&#257;ngba, and to one side was
Nungchongba&rsquo;s dwelling place, which consisted of three small
stones, with a fourth one placed on the top. In front of these a bull
is sacrificed once in three years, and dancing and singing take place
every year after the harvest. The Chiru believe in
&ldquo;Rampus,&rdquo; which in some respects appear to be the same as
the Lushai &ldquo;Huai,&rdquo; but in others they appear to be local
gods. The four chief Rampus live one on Kobru, a high hill overlooking
the northern extremity of the Manipur valley and called by the
Manipuris the guardian of the north, one in Kangjupkhul, the village
site of my informants, one on Makong hill and one in the valley of
Manipur. Twice a year the Rampu of Kobra is honoured with the sacrifice
of a dog, while pigs, fowls, or goats are offered to the others. In
July a dog is killed in honour of the first three and a pig in honour
of the last-named. In case of very serious illness, when the Daibawl
sacrifices have proved unavailing, special sacrifices are made to the
three chief Rampus above mentioned. These four Rampus are evidently
nearer to local godlings than the multitudinous and ill-defined Huais
of the Lushais. In July Pathian also is honoured, a pig being killed on
behalf of the whole village, while each household sacrifices a fowl.
The day is held sacred, no work being done. It is known as
Chapui-chol-lai&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, holiday in the great heat. The four
Rampus can only have come into prominence since the settlement of the
hamlet at Kangjupkhul, and it is probable that different ones are
worshipped by other hamlets. The Chiru also perform Sakhua sacrifices
as the Lushais do. The Tikhup denied all knowledge of any devils or
semi-divine beings, saying that they worshipped Pathian and him only.
Every year in Phalgun they sacrifice a pig and a cock to Pathian, and
much zu is drunk. In cases of sickness sacrifices of pigs or fowls and
offerings of flowers, eggs, and rice are made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>to
Pathian. Dogs are never sacrificed. I think this is the only clan in
which they are not. I failed to find out the cause of this.</p>
<p class="par">In the other clans the sacrifices are combined with
festivals either in connection with the crops, the dead, or
Thangchhuah, and are not simply in honour of the god.</p>
<p class="par">The puithiam of the Lushais becomes &ldquo;thempu&rdquo;
and in some clans &ldquo;khulpu.&rdquo; The last name seems to indicate
his responsibility for protecting the village from all ills and
misfortunes by performing the necessary sacrifices (khul = village, pu
= protector). He appears here as one of the village officials, which is
the natural result of the inhabitants of each village being all of the
same clan, instead of many clans, as among the Lushais. The functions
and methods of the thempu and khulpu appear to be the same as those of
his Lushai <i>confr&egrave;re</i>. There are various restrictions
imposed on pregnant women. Among the Anal she may not eat chillies or
honey, and her husband must not touch a snake or a corpse. The Kolhen
prohibit her from killing a snake, attending a funeral ceremony, and
eating a crab, eggs, and a certain vegetable called &ldquo;chak&rdquo;
in its young state. The Lamgang also debar her from touching a corpse,
but the prohibited articles of food are a sort of fish called
&ldquo;ngarin&rdquo; and a small animal which I have not succeeded in
identifying. The birth ceremonies are much alike; in every clan there
is a period during which the woman, and in some cases the house, is
&ldquo;sherh.&rdquo; During this time the mother&rsquo;s movements are
restricted in some way.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Aimol the period is five days in case of a
boy, and three in case of a girl; among the Anal and Purum, three days
in both cases; among the Chawte, Kom, and Vaiphei, five. Among the
Chiru the period is extended to ten days, during which the mother must
not go out and no one but near relations may enter the house. Among the
Kolhen the period is also ten days, but all women of the village may
enter the house; the mother must eat no flesh, and fowls only may be
sacrificed. Cohabitation is prohibited for three months. Among the
Tikhup the restriction on the mother&rsquo;s movements lasts only till
the disposal of the afterbirth by special persons who clean up the
house; till this is done no one may take a light <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>from
the fire or remove any article from the house. In every case at the
conclusion of this period there is a sacrifice. The custom of the Aimol
is for the &ldquo;thempu&rdquo; to pour out a libation of zu and herbs
in front of the house and invoke the child&rsquo;s spirit to take up
its residence within the new-born infant. The name is given at the same
time, the father&rsquo;s family choosing the name of a son and the
mother&rsquo;s of a daughter. On the day of the birth of an Anal child,
the &ldquo;khulpu&rdquo; is called, and after he has muttered certain
incantations, zu and fish are distributed to the whole village. All
sacrificing is prohibited for three days, and cohabitation for three
months. When distributing the zu and fish, the household
gods&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Sakhua&mdash;are invoked and the soul of
the child is summoned. Among the Chawte the thempu attends on the day
of the birth, and sacrifices a fowl and sips zu. He then mutters
incantations over a piece of turmeric which is then thrown out of the
house. On the fifth day a fowl is killed, and as the name selected is
pronounced three grains of rice are dropped into a cup of water, and if
they sink the name is approved, but if they float another one must be
selected and tested in the same manner.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru ceremonies are more elaborate. After ten days
the thempu comes to the house, a rakeng tree is planted in front of it,
and then the thempu sacrifices a hen on behalf of the mother, and a
cock or a hen, according to the sex of the child, on its behalf. The
parents eat the flesh of the birds, and the sherh and bones are buried
in the house. Two or three pots of zu are consumed by married persons.
The thempu, taking some zu in his mouth, goes round inside the house,
blowing it out on the walls and muttering charms. The mother can now
leave the house, but for three or four days must not leave the village.
The &ldquo;keng-puna&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ming-puna&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;name-giving&rdquo;&mdash;takes place almost immediately. Two
cocks or hens, according to the sex of the infant, are killed by the
thempu, and their blood smeared on the infant&rsquo;s forehead and
navel, some of the feathers being tied in its hair. The Kolhen pierce
the child&rsquo;s ears and give the name on the tenth day, the ceremony
being the same as among the Chiru on that day. The maternal grandfather
is expected to give the child a pair of brass earrings, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>bracelets, leg ornaments, and a string of glass
beads, and it is generally named after him&mdash;a custom also followed
by the Koms, who combine the name-giving and ear-piercing, giving a
feast for the purpose, on the expiration of the five days&rsquo; sherh.
The ear-piercing is done by the paternal aunt. The Lamgang ceremonies
are the same as those of the Anal, but the father is prohibited from
eating the flesh of fowls during the sherh period, while the mother is
under no restriction as regards diet. No other animal may be sacrificed
during that time, and cohabitation is not allowed for one month. The
Purum customs are severely simple. The thempu comes and mutters charms
on the day of the birth, and returns on the third day and makes a
libation of zu. No sacrifices are allowed. The name is given on the
second day by the midwife, and the ears are pierced on the seventh day,
but in neither case is there any ceremony. The Tikhup give the name at
a feast, to which the elders of the community are invited; a cock is
killed and zu dispensed freely. In case of the parents being poor, this
feast may be postponed till the child is two years old.</p>
<p class="par">The custom of summoning the child&rsquo;s soul reminds
one of the Lushai prohibition of labour on the part of the parents for
seven days after the child&rsquo;s birth, lest its soul, which hovers
around them during that period, be injured.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Ceremonies connected with
marriage.</span> Where marriage is by service, it is only natural that
the actual ceremony should be of little importance, for the couple have
been living as man and wife during the whole time; but there are
exceptions.</p>
<p class="par">At an Aimol wedding two thempus are necessary&mdash;one
of the bridegroom&rsquo;s, and one of the bride&rsquo;s family. Each
kills a cock, the feathers of which are tied round the necks of the
happy pair, after which there is the usual orgy. The Chiru and Tikhup
custom is almost identical, but the village thempu officiates alone.
Among the Kolhen, the young man&rsquo;s mother makes six visits to the
parents of her future daughter-in-law, taking an offering of zu, and
being accompanied by her eldest son-in-law or other male relative, and
on the last occasion by two or three women. Two days after the last
visit, the price is fixed, and the day for the ceremony chosen by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s father and the village officials. The bridegroom, on
the day before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>that fixed for the marriage, goes to the
girl&rsquo;s house, accompanied by several male friends, and makes a
present of three pots of zu to her parents. The next morning the bride,
accompanied by the unmarried girls of the village, goes to her future
home, taking with her two jars of zu, a hen, a piece of ginger, a dog,
a strap for carrying loads, a new cloth, and a bracelet. She parts from
her friends, with many tears, on the doorstep of her new home. The
khulpu decapitates a fowl and throws it down; if the right leg falls
over the left a happy married life is assured. The night is spent in
singing and dancing, and the following night in the same way, but in
the house of the bride, who on the next morning quits her
father&rsquo;s house for good. On the day of the marriage the bride and
bridegroom must not leave the village. This taking of omens by killing
a cock is practised by the Lamgang and Kom. Where marriage is not by
service the preliminaries in all clans resemble much those among the
Kolhen. Among the Vaiphei, and, I think, in some other clans, the young
man has to give a feast to the young men frequenting the same
dormitory. A similar custom is described in Fielding Hall&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Inward Light,&rdquo; page 104, as existing in Burma.
&ldquo;It is an old custom for the village boys to band themselves
together in a company.... But when one marries he ceases to belong to
the company, for he is about to enter into another and a wider life. He
is a deserter and a traitor to his fellows. Therefore they lay in wait
for him and caught him as he went home at night, and, taking him
without the village gate, they tried him and found him guilty. With
mock ceremony he was condemned to be turned out from their ranks, and
to pay a fine wherewith his comrades might drown their sorrow at his
desertion. Then with laughter and song, to the light of torches, they
took him home in long procession.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Widows are allowed to remarry, but as a rule the
brothers of the deceased husband have a prior claim, and if the woman
marries anyone else before the annual feast in honour of the dead she
has to pay a fine, which in some clans is as much as Rs. 120/-, to her
brother-in-law. Until this annual feast has come round she must remain
in her late husband&rsquo;s house, but when that has been performed she
may return to her father&rsquo;s house <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>if she wishes to, but
in that case the brother-in-law will take the dead man&rsquo;s property
and children.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Ceremonies connected with
death.</span> All these clans bury their dead in special cemeteries
outside the village, and unnatural deaths or deaths in childbirth are
universally considered signs that the deceased has failed in some way,
and the corpses of such unfortunates are buried outside the cemetery
and with scant ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Aimol, the corpse of the khul-lakpa is carried
round the village before being taken to the grave. The corpse of one
who has gained honours equivalent to Thangchhuah among the Lushais is
enclosed in a rough log coffin and kept for two days amid much drinking
and feasting, which recalls the funeral ceremonies of a Lushei chief.
With a rich man many cloths are buried and with a poor man at least
one. In addition some cooked rice, zu, a dao, some meat, and a bow and
arrow are deposited in the grave. The bow and arrow are a survival, for
such weapons have been long obsolete. Over the grave a small house is
built in which some meat and zu are placed to attract the
&ldquo;Khawhring.&rdquo; Spears are then thrust through the house,
which is then thrown away. I am not quite clear whether the
&ldquo;Khawhring&rdquo; in this case is supposed, as among the Lushais,
to have inhabited the body of the deceased, or whether it is believed
to be a disembodied spirit which is on the lookout for the soul of the
deceased.</p>
<p class="par">Three days after the burial a wild animal is killed and
zu and rice are offered, and the spirit of the deceased is asked to go
away and not to trouble the living who have sacrificed and made an
offering of zu and rice. The Anal make a distinction between deaths in
childbirth and deaths by accident or in war. In the former case the
body is buried in the cemetery, the grave being dug by those of her
household, and food and drink and domestic utensils are deposited
therein. The husband has to sacrifice a pig and feast the village
before the burial, and the village is &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; for that day.
The first stones and earth are placed in the grave by aged men, and the
filling then completed by young men. The thempu having muttered some
charms, the young men and women sing and dance for the deliverance of
the soul. In cases of ordinary death the grave is dug by men not of the
household, but in case of unnatural death only old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>grey-headed men may perform the task, and the
grave is dug in the jungle and no dance or song terminates the funeral,
but the village is not &ldquo;sherh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Chawte make their cemetery some distance from the
village. The dead are buried on the day of death. Over each grave a
mound is raised and fenced round with a bamboo trellis-work. A small
post carved faintly to resemble the human form is placed over the grave
of a man, while a hoe, axe, and winnowing fan denote the grave of a
woman. On each grave rests a flat basket containing some flowers and a
small jar of water. Behind each grave is a rough representation of a
house raised some four feet from the ground, which is also ornamented
with flowers, and some of the deceased&rsquo;s clothes hang from it,
while inside are placed a bamboo full of zu and a small cup, which is
filled with clean water, and a handful of raw rice. These are changed
every third or fourth day till the Thi-duh ceremony comes round in May,
when there is a feast, and portions of meat and some zu are placed on
each fresh grave.</p>
<p class="par">On the death of a Chiru, guns are fired and gongs
beaten, and a fowl, pig, and goat are killed at once. There is the
usual funeral feast, and food and personal effects, including his comb,
are buried with him. The house is &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; for three days,
during which rice is placed in a small basket in the house and then
thrown on to the grave. On the third day the house is purified by the
thempu sacrificing a cock. In nearly every clan the house has to be
purified by the thempu besprinkling it with either consecrated water or
zu, and in many cases the funeral party are similarly purified. The
Kolhen bury the bodies of those who die natural deaths in front of
their houses, as do the Lushais, and the funeral feast closely
resembles that held by the Lushais. The body of a khul-lakpa is carried
three times round his memorial stone, from left to right. A bow and
arrow are placed in the grave. The village is &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; for
three days for any death. The Lamgang follow the same customs as the
Anal, but the bodies of women who die in childbirth are not buried in
the graveyard. The Kom and the Purum have the curious custom that the
duty of digging the grave in case of an unnatural death falls on the
son-in-law of the deceased. They say that the spirit of the dead cries
out at the place where he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>met his death until appeased by an
offering of tobacco leaves and rice. The Tikhup funeral is exactly the
same as that of an ordinary Lushai. The Vaiphei dress up the corpse and
strap it on to a bamboo frame, as do the Lushais, and feast around it
for three days if food and drink suffice for so long. At the end of the
feast the thempu pours some zu down the throat of the corpse and bids
the spirit go in peace, and the body is carried to the grave, but if
the deceased has attained Thangchhuah honours, it is first earned round
the village. The household of the deceased abstain from washing or
dressing the hair till some wild animal has been killed. The custom of
giving something to the maternal grandfather or uncle on the occasion
of a death, known among the Lushais as &ldquo;lukawng,&rdquo; is found
among several clans. Among the Tikhup and Kolhen, for instance, he
receives the neck of the animal killed on the occasion of the funeral,
and in the last-named clan he also receives a pipe or Rs. 2/-. The
custom known among the Kabui and other allied tribes in Manipur as
&ldquo;mandu,&rdquo; which ordains that a widower shall pay his
deceased wife&rsquo;s father a certain sum as the price of her bones,
is only found among the Kolhen, with whom it is usual to pay Rs. 5/- or
6/-. Among the Kolhen a child dying within ten days of its birth is
buried under the eaves of the house, and is called
&ldquo;thichhiat&rdquo; equivalent to the &ldquo;hlamzuih&rdquo; among
the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Festivals.</span> 1.
<i>Connected with Crops.</i>&mdash;The Tikhup, the only monotheistic
clan in the hills, have no ceremonies connected with the crops, but
allow no dancing, singing, or music in the village between the sowing
and the reaping.</p>
<p class="par">Among the other Old Kuki clans there is a great
resemblance between the festivals, and their connection with the Lushai
&ldquo;Kuts&rdquo; can be easily traced&mdash;in some cases, as among
the Kom, the name being actually the same.</p>
<p class="par">A festival which is common to several clans and
generally takes place in the spring, though sometimes later, and is
supposed to ensure good crops and good luck generally, is known by
various similar names, all meaning &ldquo;Pulling the
Creeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kolhen &ldquo;Keidun&rdquo; Festival.</i>&mdash;This
occurs in April. The first day, called &ldquo;Karamindai,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Changritakhoi,&rdquo; is occupied <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>by the young men
going off to bring in two long creepers. A fowl and a pig are
sacrificed and the creepers are hung over a post. On the next day the
creepers are brought to the khul-lakpa&rsquo;s stone, and he, saying
certain charms, pours out a libation of rice beer, and then a tug of
war takes place between two parties selected as follows:&mdash;On one
side are all the young men of the khul-lakpa&rsquo;s family&mdash;viz.,
the Chongthu&mdash;and on the other those of the Jete, to which the
lup-lakpa belongs. With the Chongthu pull the young men of the
following families&mdash;viz., Tulthung, Maite, Tiante, Laishel,
Songchungnung, while with the Jete are associated the young men of the
Lunglai, Rembual, Mirem Tumtin, and Vanbie. The girls of each family
pull on the opposite side to the young men of their family. While the
pull is in progress the khul-lakpa sings a song, and when he reaches a
certain point the rope is cut in two by a man who stands waiting with a
dao. The pull is repeated with the second creeper, and each party
carries off the ends it has retained. Marriages are only allowed
between the young people who pull on the same side, with the exception
of the Chongthu, who, being of the chief&rsquo;s family, may marry a
girl of any family except their own. During the festival no work of any
sort must be done, but otherwise there are no restrictions as regards
villagers or strangers, but the khul-lakpa must abstain from work and
from cohabitation for two or three days before. Should a death occur a
day or two before the date fixed for the festival, the fact will not be
recognised till the completion of the feast, when the funeral
ceremonies will take place as if the death had occurred on that day,
the corpse being kept outside the village during the interval.</p>
<p class="par">The Anal and Lamgang, as usual, observe the festival in
a similar manner. The creeper having been brought to the gate of the
village, the headmen and the thempu receive it, and the latter,
muttering prayers, pours over it a libation of rice beer, and then ties
a piece of it to the gate. The remainder is cut up and a piece is tied
to each house in the village. The thempu goes round at night throwing a
piece of turmeric into each house and calling out as he throws each
piece, &ldquo;From to-day may all evil and misfortune run away from
this house.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6455src" href=
"#xd24e6455" name="xd24e6455src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Purum celebrate the festival in August, and the
unmarried girls take a prominent part in the ceremony. A raised
platform is made before the house of the eldest unmarried girl in the
village. (In a community where there is no dearth of husbands, and
every girl is sure of being married in due course, the prominence given
to the eldest spinster is not objected to as it might be in an English
village.) On this platform the girls assemble, and the creeper after
the usual ceremonies is tied to the platform, and there is a great
feast with much dancing between the young folk.</p>
<p class="par">The similarity between these festivals and the
&ldquo;Koi-hrui-an-chat,&rdquo; mentioned under the Ngente, bears out
the truth of the tradition that these clans long ago were near
neighbours.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru at the time of cutting the jhums go in
procession with drums and gongs to the place chosen and on their return
drink much rice beer. In March or April, before the sowing, a festival
called &ldquo;Arem&rdquo; is celebrated. On the first day a dog is
killed at a stone to the west of the village, and a pig to the north in
the direction of the hill Kobru. All the men attend, but no women. The
animals are killed by the thempu. The flesh is eaten there by the whole
party, and the &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; are left at the place of sacrifice.
There is then a drinking party in the house of the thempu. On the
second day all the young men go and catch fish, and on their return
they are entertained with two pots of rice beer by the unmarried girls.
On the third day the lup-lakpa gives a feast of meat and rice, washed
down by much rice beer, to the men only, and later all dance in front
of the &ldquo;chhirbuk&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Lushai zawlbuk.</p>
<p class="par">The fourth day is spent in visiting each other, drinking
and singing at each other&rsquo;s houses. As soon as it is dark men and
women meet before the chhirbuk and dance round the stone drinking; then
they go to the lup-lakpa&rsquo;s house and drink again, and then to a
house where all the unmarried girls are collected and drink again, and
then bring the girls to the chhirbuk and dance round the stone again,
drinking as they go. This is a pretty heavy day&rsquo;s work, and it
speaks well for the young folk if many of them have the energy to
complete the programme by drinking and dancing together on the fifth
day. During the festival the village is &ldquo;sherh.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Chawte, before cutting their jhums, sacrifice a pig
and go down to the stream and sharpen their daos&mdash;&ldquo;Trust in
God, but keep your powder dry.&rdquo; The above festivals correspond to
the &ldquo;Chap-ch&#257;r-kut&rdquo; of the Lushais, and the following
resemble the &ldquo;Mim-kut.&rdquo; The Purum in September observe
&ldquo;Chulkut&rdquo; for five days, making and exchanging rice cakes
and drinking rice beer, but not sacrificing any animals. The Kolhen
observe &ldquo;Chamershi&rdquo; for two days in the middle of the
rains&mdash;viz., in July or August. A pig and a cock are sacrificed in
the khul-lakpa&rsquo;s house and eaten there by men only. Old men
dance, and rice beer is drunk. This feast is supposed to expel evil
spirits. The Chiru in July sacrifice a pig on behalf of the village to
Pathian, while each household offers him a fowl. This feast is called
the &ldquo;feast of the hot season rest&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
few days of leisure after the second weeding of the crops.</p>
<p class="par">The Aimol, after burning the jhums, celebrate a feast
they call &ldquo;Lo-an-dai.&rdquo; Three fowls are killed and eaten in
the khulpu&rsquo;s house, and rice beer is drunk, but no gong-beating
or singing is allowed.</p>
<p class="par">After the harvest, feasts corresponding to the Lushai
&ldquo;Polkut&rdquo; are held, but among the Purum a feast called
&ldquo;Shanghong&rdquo; has to be celebrated in October, just when the
grain is filling in the ear. Every householder has to bring a small
sheaf of the green rice, which is presented to the village god, and
feasting and drinking goes on for three days, during which time the
village is &ldquo;sherh.&rdquo; The Kolhen, before reaping the crop,
carry the khul-lakpa or lup-lakpa out of the village towards the fields
with beating of drums, and later drink at his expense.</p>
<p class="par">The Kom call the harvest festival &ldquo;Lam-kut.&rdquo;
It lasts three days. No sacrifice is performed, but the young men and
girls dance and drink together.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Chawte the custom is practically the same as
among the Purum, save that the feast only lasts one day.</p>
<p class="par">The Lamgang and Anal harvest festival is practically the
same. In each case the best crop in the village is reaped by the whole
community going to the field with dance and song, and subsequently the
lucky owner of the crop has to entertain the village for three days. It
would appear that all good Lamgangs and Anals must pray to have the
second best crop. On the second <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>day of the feast the
consumption of meat and tobacco, the carrying of water and wood, and
working with axes or hoes are tabu. The feast closely resembles the
&ldquo;Buh-Ai&rdquo; of other clans. The Aimol custom is very different
from that of the other clans. All the men go out in search of game, the
flesh of which is eaten in the evening, and drums are beaten and songs
sung while the rice beer circulates freely, in contrast to the feast at
the sowing time. Dancing is, however, tabu. The harvest feast is called
&ldquo;Sherh an long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Lamgang have an extra feast, or rather period of
rest, when the grain is all garnered, when for ten days no one may
enter or leave the village, and no work can be done, the whole energies
of the community being concentrated on eating and drinking well.</p>
<p class="par">2. <i>Feasts Corresponding with the Thangchhuah Feasts
of the Lushai.</i>&mdash;The idea of &ldquo;Thangchhuah&rdquo; is found
in some form or other in all clans. Even in those clans who have no
very clear conception of a special abode for the spirits of those who
have earned good fortune in the world beyond the grave by feasts and
killing men and animals here below, we find feasts the giving of which
confers on the giver special consideration among his fellow-villagers
and entitles his corpse to special funeral honours. All these feasts
seem more or less connected with the erection of some form of
memorial&mdash;either a post, such as the Lushai
&ldquo;she-lu-pun,&rdquo; which finds its counterpart among several Old
Kuki clans, but among them the erection of the memorial is the
important part of the ceremony, whereas among the Lushais the killing
of the animal is the more important and the feast is named after that,
not after the planting of the post; or a stone or a heap of stones, or
a paved platform. All these are erected during a man&rsquo;s life and
are quite distinct from the memorials erected in memory of the
deceased, and thus connect the Lushai-Kuki race with the Nagas, among
whom the erection of stones is a very important function.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Mi-thi-rawp-l&#257;m&rdquo; is not included
in the Thangchhuah series by any of these clans&mdash;in fact, it seems
to be omitted by all clans not living under Lushei chiefs. These all
have a special annual ceremony to lay the ghosts of those who have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>died during the preceding year. The explanation
of this seems to be that among the Lushais the clans have all been
broken up and are scattered in different villages, and therefore an
annual clan ceremony is not possible, and it has become a virtuous act
for some wealthy member of the clan to celebrate the feast in honour of
the dead of the clan. Among the clans which have retained their
corporate existence the annual ceremony is natural, and therefore it is
excluded from the Thangchhuah series.</p>
<p class="par">The Tikhup can earn consideration after death by giving
a single feast. The young men and maidens collect a big heap of stones
and arrange a seat of honour near it for the giver of the feast, who is
carried down on a litter. The young folk dance and sing and drink
before him, and then he is carried back to the village and has to
present a mithan to the young men, who feast on it for a day and a
night at the house of their leader. A song is composed in honour of the
giver of the feast, which is sung at all subsequent feasts.</p>
<p class="par">The Lamgang, Kom, Kolhen, and Anal put up wooden posts,
the Chawte erect a post and pave a piece of ground in front of it,
while the Aimol put up a stone and make a pavement. Mithan and pigs are
killed, and a feast given which lasts several days, the cost being met
by the person ambitious of fame.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru alone seem to have no idea of Thangchhuah,
and, as noted before, have no idea of a special abode for good
spirits.</p>
<p class="par">The Vaiphei have to give two feasts, at the first of
which one, and at the second two or more, mithan are killed. The
Kolhen, on occasion of putting up the post, sacrifice a mithan
thus:&mdash;The thempu first throws an egg at the forehead of the
mithan, muttering a charm to drive away all evil; the animal is then
speared until blood is drawn, after which it may be shot. They also
give the following feasts as part of the Thangchhuah
ceremonies:&mdash;&ldquo;Khuang-that&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;making a drum.&rdquo; The first day is occupied in bringing the
log which is to be hollowed into the drum; on the second there is a
dance outside the house of the giver of the feast; on the third the
mithan is killed after a thempu has broken the egg on its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>forehead, and then another thempu invokes its
spirit, blowing rice-beer over the body, as at the Fanai festival, p.
138. The fourth and fifth days are occupied with feasting.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Lungainai&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;collection of stones&rdquo;&mdash;this is very similar to the
Tikhup festival, with the carrying of the giver omitted; a mithan is
killed as above described. The Aimol have also the drum-making feast,
and another in which the giver is carried on a litter, but no heap of
stones is made. On each occasion much rice-beer and flesh has to be
consumed.</p>
<p class="par">3. <i>Other Feasts.</i>&mdash;Mostly annual, if
necessary provisions are forthcoming. Some of these probably have
reference to the crops.</p>
<p class="par">The Purum celebrate &ldquo;Yarr&rdquo; in February for
seven days. Dancing begins each evening at sundown, and is kept up all
night with feasting and drinking. In March they keep
&ldquo;Kumyai&rdquo; for three days, the young men and maidens dancing
and drinking together, but no animals are killed. This seems probably
equivalent to the &ldquo;Chap-ch&#257;r-kut&rdquo; of the Lushais, but
both it and the Yarr are said to be to please the village god, without
any special reference to the crops. The Lamgang have a peculiar feast
early in May, when the young men plant a very tall bamboo, from the end
of which hangs a wooden representation of a bird, at which every man in
turn, commencing with the thempu and the khul-lakpa, shoot with bows
and arrows. Mithan are killed and eaten. No woman is allowed to join
this festival.</p>
<p class="par">The Chiru and Kolhen celebrate a somewhat similar
festival called &ldquo;Ratek&rdquo; in the middle of August. A pig and
a dog are sacrificed by the thempu outside the village, on the side
towards Kobru, and then two or three days later an offering of zu is
placed in a small bamboo tube beside the water supply, and the drum is
beaten for some time; the party then return to the khul-lakpa&rsquo;s
house and are treated to a drink. The following day a tall bamboo is
planted in the village with a wonderfully ornamented basket hanging
from it, and much zu drunk. The following year the bamboo is taken up
and thrown away, the festival being named &ldquo;Ratek poiyi&rdquo;
(<i>cf.</i> Lushai &ldquo;pai,&rdquo; to throw away). Before the feast
young men go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>hunting, and if they are successful good luck is
sure to follow. The first day of the feast a pig and a dog are
sacrificed, and zu drunk; on the second, the bamboo is thrown away and
more zu drunk in the house of the khul-lakpa. On the third day the
unmarried girls of the village give a drinking feast to the young men,
and both dance together. Should the zu suffice this portion of the
festival may be prolonged for several days.</p>
<p class="par">It is believed that unless these two festivals are
carried out every year in their proper rotation, there will be serious
mortality among the elders of the village.</p>
<p class="par">Since writing the above, I have found two more small
clans, which evidently belong to the Old Kuki group&mdash;Lonte or
Ronte, of whom there are only nine households, living alongside of the
Burma road, close to the Chawte hamlet, with whom they are classed by
the Manipuris; and Tarau, eighteen households living slightly to the
south of the Burma road.</p>
<p class="par">The Ronte clan is divided into two families, called Lanu
and Changom. Marriages can only be made with members of the other
family of the clan. They say that they came from the Ngente hill far to
the south (<i>v.</i> Ngente clan), and claim some connection with the
Chiru and Aimol.</p>
<p class="par">The Tarau clan is divided into four families, and
marriages are restricted as among the Chawte, Chiru, and Kolhen.</p>
<p class="par">A youth of the Pachana family must marry a girl of the
Tlangsha family.</p>
<p class="par">A youth of the Tlangsha family must marry a girl of the
Thimasha family.</p>
<p class="par">A youth of the Thimasha family must marry a girl of the
Khulpu-in family.</p>
<p class="par">A youth of the Khulpu-in family must marry a girl of the
Pachana family.</p>
<p class="par">In both clans the young men sleep in any house, except
their parents&rsquo;, in which there are unmarried girls. The Ronte say
that formerly they built zawlbuks like the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">The price of a Tarau girl is a gong or Rs. 30/-, or five
years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>service in the girl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
house. The Ronte maiden&rsquo;s price is two gongs, and her proper
husband is her maternal first cousin. In both clans a fowl has to be
killed by the khulpu at the time of the marriage, and the Ronte tie
some of its feathers round the necks of the couple. Should a Tarau
maiden be led astray both parties are fined a pot of rice-beer, which
the villagers share, and the seducer pays the girl&rsquo;s father one
pig. The child, when old enough to leave the mother, becomes the
property of the father. A Ronte mother must not leave her house till
five days after the birth of a daughter and seven after that of a son.
On the day of the birth there is a feast, and on the fifth or seventh
day, according to the sex of the child, a fowl is killed by the khulpu,
and the child&rsquo;s hair is cut, its ears pierced, and its name
decided on, the choice being made from the names of its forefathers.
The house is purified by being sprinkled with zu by the khulpu.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Tarau, the period during which the mother may
not leave her house is prolonged to ten days, at the expiry of which
the khulpu kills a cock for male child and a hen for girl, and then
purifies the house.</p>
<p class="par">In both clans the dead are buried in a cemetery situated
to the west of the village, while the corpses of those who have died
unnatural deaths are buried elsewhere with no ceremony. Women dying in
childbirth among the Tarau are buried by old men, who have no further
hope of becoming fathers, far from the village, while persons being
killed by wild animals, or by some accident, such as a fall from a
tree, are buried where they die. Persons who are drowned are buried on
the bank of the river where the body is found, the grave being dug at
the spot where some water thrown up by hand from the river happens to
fall. This custom also exists among the Shans of the Upper Chindwin,
which lends some colour to the tradition that the Tarau sojourned in
Burma before entering Manipur. Among the Ronte, women dying in
childbirth, and all children dying under a year of age, are buried to
the east of the village, while accidental deaths necessitate the burial
being made to the south. The funeral takes place on the day of death
except <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>in the case of old men, whose corpses are kept
for a day while their friends eat, drink, and dance before them.
Whatever animals can be spared are killed in the honour of the
deceased, and their sherh are buried with him, together with some rice.
Every day till the &ldquo;Papek&rdquo; feast, in honour of those who
have died within the year, rice and zu are placed on the grave. At
Papek a platform of bamboo is constructed near the cemetery, and on it
are placed such offering of flesh as the family can afford; much zu is
drunk and all dance. The Ronte Sakhua sacrifice consists of a goat,
dogs and mithan being prohibited.</p>
<p class="par">Although the Tarau, from their language, are evidently
closely allied to the Lushais, they are the only Old Kuki clan I have
met which does not worship Pathian. They denied all knowledge of that
name, affirming the name of their god was &ldquo;R&#257;pu,&rdquo; to
whom the Manipuri name of &ldquo;Sankhulairenma&rdquo; has been given.
R&#257;pu has a shrine just above the Burma road near to Tegnopal,
where every year fish, rice, and zu are offered to him. When the rice
begins to fill in the ear there is a five days&rsquo; feast in the
village, during which time the young people dance and drink. A pig is
killed, and the liver, ears, feet, and snout are offered to R&#257;pu.
These are called &ldquo;sar&rdquo; (<i>cf.</i> Lushai
&ldquo;sherh&rdquo;). Before the cutting of jhums commences a small pig
or a fowl is sacrificed to R&#257;pu so that no one may be cut with a
dao during the clearing of the jhums. Dogs are not eaten or sacrificed
by the Tarau or the Ronte; the latter also consider the mithan unfit
for a sacrifice. In these particulars they form an exception to the
general custom of Kuki clans.</p>
<p class="par">The Ronte have a feast called &ldquo;Va-en-la,&rdquo;
which is given with the idea of enhancing the giver&rsquo;s importance
in this world and assuring him comfort in the next. A pig is killed and
thirty pots of zu are prepared, and the whole village makes merry. A
long bamboo is planted in front of the house of the giver of the feast.
Throughout its length this bamboo is transfixed with crosspieces of
bamboo about 18 inches long; from its end depends a bamboo
representation of a bird, whence the name of the
feast&mdash;&ldquo;va,&rdquo; in Ronte, as in Lushai, meaning &ldquo;a
bird,&rdquo; and &ldquo;en,&rdquo; &ldquo;to see.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">To show the similarity between the Tarau and the Lushai
language I give a few words of each.</p>

<p class="par first">1. <i>Legends.</i>&mdash;A large number of tales
have been collected by Babu Nithor Nath Banerji, of the Manipur State
Office, from which I select the following. They have all to a certain
extent suffered by being told to the Babu in Manipuri instead of in the
vernacular of the relaters. This accounts for Manipuri names being used
in some cases.</p>
<p class="par">The following is a tale told by the
Anals:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time the whole world was flooded. All
were drowned except one man and one woman, who ran to the highest peak
of the Leng hill [this is interesting, as Leng is the name of one of
the highest hills in the present Lushai Hills], where they climbed up a
high tree and hid themselves among its branches. The tree grew near a
large pond, which was as clear as the eye of a crow. They made
themselves as comfortable as they could, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>being determined to
spend the night there. They passed the night, sometimes exchanging
whispers, and in the morning they were astonished to find that they had
become a tiger and a tigress. [This changing of human beings into
animals reminds one of the Lushai Thimzing legend.] Pathian, seeing the
sad state of the world, sent a man and a woman from a cave, which was
on the hill, to re-people it. The man and the woman emerging from the
cave were terrified at seeing the two huge animals, and addressed
Pathian thus: &lsquo;O Father, you have sent us to re-people the world,
but we do not think that we shall be able to carry out your intention,
as the whole world is under water, and the only spot on which we could
make a resting place is occupied by two ferocious beasts which are
waiting to devour us; give us strength to slay these animals.&rsquo;
After which they killed the tigers and lived happily and begat many
sons and daughters, and from them the world was
re-populated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following tale told by the Kolhen resembles in many
particulars the story of Kungori told by Colonel Lewin, which is given

<h4 class="main"><i>The Story of Fachirang and Rangchar.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Once upon a time there lived a widow; she
had a daughter whose beauty attracted many young men of the village.
One day a tiger came in the shape of a man and asked to marry the girl.
She was much frightened and kept silence. The tiger-man was angry at
her behaviour, and recited a charm which made her ugly. Her mother
said, &lsquo;Look! my daughter who was the most beautiful girl in the
village has become ugly; if a man can restore her beauty he may marry
her, and if a woman can do it she shall be my friend.&rsquo; On hearing
this, the tiger-man came to the old woman and said, &lsquo;Oh! Granny,
I am a stranger, and have come from a distant village; let me put up in
your house.<span class="corr" id="xd24e6767" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> The old lady agreed, and after a few
days he said, &lsquo;Oh! Granny, why are you so sad? Tell me the cause
of your sorrow. Perhaps I can remove it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas, my boy, it
is beyond your power to do so,&rsquo; she replied. The tiger-man,
however, pressed her to tell him, and at last she did so, whereupon he
replied, &lsquo;All right, if I cure her you will give her to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>me,&rsquo; and in a few days he had restored her
beauty, and they were married and lived together in her mother&rsquo;s
house for many years. At length he asked permission to take his wife to
his own home, and they started, but no sooner had they passed the
village gate than he was changed into the shape of a tiger, and his
wife wept much at seeing him thus. An old woman of the village saw them
and came and told the people that a tiger was carrying off the girl, so
the villagers assembled to consult, but no one would volunteer for the
task of rescuing the girl. At last Fachirang and Rangchar, two
brothers, set off with a dao and a spear to kill the animal, but after
going a very little way Fachirang, the elder brother, said, &lsquo;Oh!
Rangchar, I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter, but my heart beats so
fast that I must remain here; you go and see if you can kill the beast
alone.&rsquo; So the younger brother went on alone till he came to the
place where the tiger and the girl were living happily. Rangchar thrust
his spear into the breast of the tiger, and it died at once, and
Rangchar carried off the girl and returned to where his brother was
waiting, and they all three set out for home together. The elder
brother married the girl, and they all lived happily
together.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">The Story of
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">(From &ldquo;Progressive Colloquial Exercises in
the Lushai Dialect&rdquo; by Captain H. Lewin, 1874.)</p>
<p class="par">Her father, who was unmarried, was splitting cane to
make a winnowing basket when he ran a splinter into his hand: the
splinter grew into a little child; (after a time) the child was brought
forth motherless and they called her K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri. They fed
her with single grains of millet and rice, and so little by little she
grew big. Two or three years passed by and she attained puberty; she
was very pretty, and all the young-men of the village wanted to marry
her, but her father refused them all. Then the young tiger-man, Keimi,
took up the impression of her foot and wrapped it up and placed it on
the bamboo grating over the house fire to dry. Then
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri became ill.</p>
<p class="par">K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;If
there be anyone that can cure her, he shall have my daughter.&rdquo;
All the villagers tried, but not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>one of them could do any
good. Then the young tiger-man came. &ldquo;I will cure her, and I will
marry her afterwards,&rdquo; said he. Her father said, &ldquo;Cure the
girl first and you may then have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So he cured her; the footprint which he had placed to
dry on the fire-shelf he opened out and threw away.
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri became well and Keimi married her. &ldquo;Come,
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you go to my
house?&rdquo; So they went; on the road Keimi turned himself into a
tiger, K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri caught hold of his tail, and they ran like
the wind. Some women of the village were gathering wood and they saw
this, so they went back home and said to K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s
father, &ldquo;Your daughter has got a tiger for a husband.&rdquo;
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;Whoever can go and
take K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri may have her,&rdquo; but no one dared to
take her. However, Hpohtir and Hrangchal, two friends, said, &ldquo;We
will take her.&rdquo; K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father said,
&ldquo;If you are able to take her you may have her,&rdquo; so Hpohtir
and Hrangchal set off. Going on they came to Keimi&rsquo;s village. The
young tiger-man, Keimi, had gone out hunting; before he reached his
house Hpohtir and Hrangchal went to K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri.
&ldquo;K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;where is your
husband?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is gone out hunting,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but will be home directly.&rdquo; On this they became afraid,
and Hpohtir and Hrangchal climbed up on to the top of the high
fire-shelf. K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s husband arrived. &ldquo;There
is the smell of a human being,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It must be my
smell,&rdquo; said K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri. Night fell; everyone ate
their dinners and lay down to rest. In the morning
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s husband again went out to hunt. A widow
said (to the two friends), &ldquo;If you are going to run away with
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri take fire-seed, thorn-seed, and water-seed (with
you).&rdquo; So they took fire-seed, thorn-seed, and water-seed, and
they took K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri also and carried her off.</p>
<p class="par">K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s husband returned home. He
looked and found K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri was gone, so he followed after
them in hot haste. A little bird called to Hrangchal. &ldquo;Run! run!
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s husband will catch you,&rdquo; said the
bird. So (the friends) scattered the fire-seed, and the jungle and
undergrowth burnt furiously, so that K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s
husband could not come any further. When the fire subsided he again
resumed the pursuit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180"
name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The little bird cried to Hrangchal, &ldquo;He is
catching you up.&rdquo; So they scattered the water-seed, and a great
river rose. However, K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s husband waited for
the water to go down, and when the water went down he followed after
them as before.</p>
<p class="par">The bird said to Hrangchal, &ldquo;He is after you
again&mdash;he is fast gaining on you; sprinkle the thorn-seed,&rdquo;
and thorns sprouted in thickets, so that K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s
husband could not get on. By biting and tearing the thorns he at length
made a way. and again he followed after them.
Hrangchal&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="n232.1src" href="#n232.1" name=
"n232.1src">2</a> party became bewildered and hid in a clump of reeds.
Hpohtir cut the tiger down dead with a blow of his dao. &ldquo;I am
Hpohtir,&rdquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n232.1">2</a> said he.
So the tiger died.</p>
<p class="par">Hrangchal and the others went on again until they came
to the three cross-roads of Khuavang, and there they stopped. Hpohtir
and Hrangchal were to keep guard turn about. Hrangchala went to sleep
first while Hpohtir kept watch.</p>
<p class="par">At night Khuavang came. &ldquo;Who is staying at my
cross-roads?&rdquo; he said. Hpohtira (spoke out boldly).
&ldquo;Hpohtira and Hrangchala (are here),&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;crouching under the reeds. We cut off the tiger&rsquo;s head
without much ado.&rdquo; Khuavang, hearing and becoming afraid, ran
off. So Hpohtira (woke up Hrangchal, saying), &ldquo;Hrangchal, get up;
you stay awake now. I am very sleepy; I will lie down. If Khuavang
comes you must not be afraid.&rdquo; Having said this he slept.
Hrangchala watched; presently Khuavang returned. &ldquo;Who is this
staying at my cross-roads?&rdquo; he said. Hrangchala was frightened;
(however), he replied, &ldquo;Hpohtira and Hrangchala (are here); they
killed the tiger that followed them among the reed-roots.&rdquo; But
Khuavang was not to be frightened by this, so he took
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri. K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri marked the road, trailing
behind her a line of cotton thread. They entered into a hole in the
earth, and so arrived at Khuavang&rsquo;s village. The hole in the
earth was stopped up by a great stone. In the morning Hpohtir and
Hrangchala began to abuse each other. Said Hpohtira to Hrangchal,
&ldquo;Fool man!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where has K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri
gone to? On account of your faintheartedness Khuavang has carried her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>off. Away! you will have to go to
Khuavang&rsquo;s village.&rdquo; So they followed
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s line of white thread and found that the
thread entered (the earth) under a big rock. They moved away the rock
and saw Khuavang&rsquo;s village below them. Hpohtira called out,
&ldquo;Hoy! give me back my K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri!&rdquo; Khuavang
replied, &ldquo;We know nothing about your K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri, whom
you were taking away.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you do not (immediately) give me
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri I will use my dao,&rdquo; said Hpohtir.
&ldquo;Hit away,&rdquo; answered Khuavang. With one cut of the dao a
quarter of the village died right off. Again Hpohtir cried, &ldquo;Give
me my K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri,&rdquo; Khuavang said, &ldquo;Your
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri is not here.&rdquo; On this Hpohtir and Hrangchal
said, &ldquo;We will come in.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said
Khuavang, so they went in and came to Khuavang&rsquo;s house.
Khuavang&rsquo;s daughter was a very pretty girl. &ldquo;Here is
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;This is not she,&rdquo;
said Hpohtir; &ldquo;give me K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri herself.&rdquo; So
(at last) they gave her to him.</p>
<p class="par">They took her away. K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri said, &ldquo;I
have forgotten my comb.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go, Hrangchal, and fetch
it,&rdquo; said Hpohtir; but Hrangchala&mdash;&ldquo;I dare not. I am
afraid,&rdquo; said he. So Hpohtir went (himself) to fetch (the comb).
While he was gone Hrangchal took K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri out and closed
the hole with the great stone. After this they arrived at the house of
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;You have been able to
release my daughter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so take her.&rdquo;
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri, however, did not agree. Said
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Hrangchal is here, but
where is Hpohtira?&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not know Hpohtira&rsquo;s
dwelling-place,&rdquo; he said. So Hrangchala and K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri
were united. Though K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri did not wish it, he just
married her.</p>
<p class="par">Hpohtira was married to Khuavang&rsquo;s daughter.
Beside the house he sowed a koi-seed. It sprouted and a creeper sprang
(upwards like a ladder). Hpohtira, when he was at Khuavang&rsquo;s, had
a child (born to him), and he cooked some small stones, and when his
wife was absent he gave the stones which he had cooked to the child,
saying, &ldquo;Eat.&rdquo; While it was eating Hpohtir climbed up the
stalks of the koi creeper and got out. He went on and arrived at the
house of K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father. They had killed a
mithan, and were celebrating the Khuangchoi and dancing. With one blow
Hpohtira cut off the head of Hrangchal! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s father cried, &ldquo;Why,
Hpohtira, do you cut off Hrangchala&rsquo;s head?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was
obliged to decapitate him,&rdquo; said Hpohtir. &ldquo;It was I who
released K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri from Keimi&rsquo;s
village&mdash;Hrangchala dared not do it. When Khuavang carried off
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri also Hrangchala dared not say him nay&mdash;he
was afraid. Afterwards we followed K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri&rsquo;s line
of cotton thread, which led us to Khuavang&rsquo;s village.
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri (after we had released her from there) forgot her
comb; we told Hrangchal to go and fetch it, but he dared not. &lsquo;I
am afraid,&rsquo; said he, so I went to get it. He then took
K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri and left me behind, shutting the hole in the
earth with a great stone. They went away. I married Khuavang&rsquo;s
daughter, and while she was absent I climbed up the stalks of the
creeper and came here.&rdquo; On this, &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; said
they. &ldquo;Then you shall be united.&rdquo; So Hrangchala died, and
Hpohtira and K&uacute;ng&oacute;ri were married. They were very
comfortable together, and killed many mithan; they possessed many
villages, and lived happy ever after. Thus the story is concluded.</p>
<p class="par">I condense the following tale told by the Kolhen from
the obviously embellished version supplied to the Babu:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">A widow had seven sons and one daughter, called
Ringchanghoi, who was very beautiful, and much beloved by her brothers.
To prove the truth of their professions of love she sent them off to
catch the sun and the moon, that she might wear them as her necklace.
Before their departure they built her a fortified house, and told her
to remain within it until their return. They also left with her some
unhusked rice, which had magical properties, turning red whenever the
brothers were in danger. Ringchanghoi one day was sitting in the
verandah cleaning her hair when she was seen by the king, who quickly
added her to the number of his wives. The youngest brother, returning
alone, found the house empty, and at once rejoining the others in the
sky, where they were still hunting the sun and moon, told them of the
disappearance of their sister. They all returned home, and on entering
the house the youngest brother was changed into a parrot, while the
others fell down dead. The youngest brother finds his sister and is
captured and presented to her, and tells her what has happened,
whereupon she sends off her husband, who by a powerful charm restores
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>the dead to life and the youngest brother to his
original form, and all ends happily.</p>
<p class="par">In this tale there is some slight resemblance to the
Lushai tale of Rimenhoi, as also there is to the tales told by many
clans to account for eclipses of the sun and moon. The Kom, for
instance, say that the god Awk-pa was drying his rice when the sun and
the moon came riding by and scattered it; this vexed Awk-pa, who lay in
ambush in a cave, and the next time they came he swallowed them. The
resemblance between this tale and the Lushai explanation of an eclipse
is very marked. The name &ldquo;Awk&rdquo; is the same, and the idea of
swallowing is preserved. The Purum, while using the same word for an
eclipse, have quite a different story:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time
there were seven brothers who went into the forest to cut wood, and
shot a deer, and ordered the youngest brother to cook it while they
went on with their work. The youngest brother, having cooked the meat,
put it on some leaves till his brothers should return. Some leaves from
a tree fell on the meat, whereupon the deer came to life again and ran
away. The brothers returning got angry and, not believing the tale told
by the youngest, killed him and put his body under the tree. Some
leaves falling on the corpse, it came to life, and the brothers were
much astonished and went home, taking some of the leaves, roots, and
bark of the tree with them.&rdquo; On their way they saw the body of a
dog floating in a river which they had to cross, and put some bark on
it and the animal revived. When they reached home they put the bark,
leaves, and pieces of root to dry in the sunshine, leaving their dog to
watch them. The sun and the moon, perceiving the usefulness of the
things, stole them all and were chased by the dog. When the dog gets
too near, the sun and the moon hide, thus causing eclipses. The Kolhen
have the same name for an eclipse, and their explanation of the
phenomenon is much the same. The god Rikumpu left his dog to watch his
garden, and the sun and the moon came to steal, and are still being
chased by the faithful hound. The Lamgang say that eclipses are caused
by their god catching the sun and the moon, who once stole his tobacco
as it was drying. The Anal have much the same idea. The story is worthy
of being given at length:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time a very pious
man who devoted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"
name="pb184">184</a>]</span>much time to worshipping God had a pet
bitch. The sun and the moon, being envious, tried to take his virtue
from the man. To accomplish their wicked purpose they promised to give
him their virtue if only he would first entrust them with his. The
saint fell into the trap and the celestial rascals ran off with his
virtue. The holy man, finding himself defrauded, ordered his dog to
catch the thieves. The dog brought a long pole and climbed up it to
reach the fugitives, being followed by her master. She reached the sky
and still chases the sun and moon, and sometimes catches them.
Therefore, when an eclipse occurs the Anal call out, &lsquo;Release!
Release!&rsquo; The poor pious man took so long ascending the pole that
before he accomplished the journey the white ants had eaten up the
lower end and the saint fell to the earth and was killed.&rdquo;
Thunder and lightning are accounted for by some clans thus:&mdash;Wulai
the lizard climbs a tall tree and shouts defiance, whereupon God from
the sky hurls his axe at him and he runs down, but the tree is burnt
up. The Anal and Kom have also a more poetic explanation of
lightning&mdash;viz., that it is the glitter of God&rsquo;s sword as he
plays with it in heaven, while the Purum also say that it is the
glitter of his robes.</p>
<p class="par">Earthquakes are accounted for by assuming the existence
of another world below the surface of the earth. The Purum and Kom say
that Yangmal the earth worm took a present of a piece of earth to the
king of these lower regions. On the way the earth was changed into gold
and silver, much to the delight of the monarch, who sent Yangmal back
to fetch more, but the worm made excuse that the upper world had been
destroyed. To test the truth of this statement the king shakes the
world. The Anal and Lamgang say that the people of the lower world
shake the upper one to find out if anyone is still alive up there, and
so on, an earthquake occurring the Anal and Lamgang villages resound
with shouts of &ldquo;Alive! Alive!&rdquo; Rainbows are accounted for
as the lips of God spread in the act of drinking, or simply his
glory.</p>
<p class="par smallNote"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;I must
acknowledge the assistance I have received in preparing the account of
these Old Kuki tribes from Babu Nithor Nath Banerji, head clerk of the
Manipur State Hill Office. My information regarding the Anal, Kom,

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Old Kuki Clans&mdash;Khawtlang and
Khawchhak</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Old Kukis who appeared in Cachar about 1780
are described by Lieutenant Stewart as being divided into three clans
called Rhangkol, Khelma, and Beteh. The first and last are known in the
Lushai Hills as Hrangchal and Biate respectively, but the Khelma, whom
Dr. Grierson identifies as the Hallam, seem to have emigrated entirely.
The Hrangchal and Biate are two of many clans collectively known to the
Lushais as Hmar&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, North&mdash;from the position of
their villages with reference to those of the Lushais, and among
themselves as Khawtlang and Khawchhak&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Western and
Eastern Villages I have found representatives of 16 clans in the Lushai
Hills and adjoining portions of Manipur. The most important are
Loitlang, subdivided into six families; Hrangchal, with four families;
Thiak, with five families; and Biate, with the same number. The old
village sites of many of these clans are still called by their names.
The Hrangchal are said to have had a large village at Vanlaiphai, in
the centre of which valley is a large memorial stone with many carvings
on it, which is said to have been erected in memory of Chonluma, a
famous Hrangchal chief of bygone days. The Biate assert that when they
lived on the hill of that name they were attacked by huge eagles, and
had to build stone shelters in which to hide their small children.
These erections are still to be seen, and consist of three rough slabs
of stone with a fourth as a roof, the whole structure being only about
2 to 3 feet high. It was the Biate, also, who fed Rulpui, as has been
described in <a href="#ch1.5.3">Part I., Chapter V, 3</a>. The
Lungthau, a minor family, attribute their downfall to an attack by
Chuckmahs, which led to their seeking refuge with the Sailo chief
Lalsavunga, and forming a village at Kelsi, near Aijal, where they were
under his protection.</p>
<p class="par">When the aggressions of the Thangur chiefs disturbed the
Khawtlang and Khawchhak one section fled through the country of the
Thados into Cachar, another took refuge among the Chhinchhuan, a Thado
family in the southern portion of the Manipur Hills, to whom they paid
tribute, and a certain number joined the Thangur villages. Between
those who fled to the Chhinchhuan and the Lushais hostilities were
carried on until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"
name="pb186">186</a>]</span>our arrival in 1890, and, as in the case of
the Vuite, we found many of them living in a state of semi-slavery in
the Sailo villages, whence they have mostly rejoined their relatives,
and there are now 296 households of these people in the south-west of
the Manipur Hills and more in the adjoining parts of the Lushai Hills.
Lieutenant Stewart, in his description of the &ldquo;Old Kukis,&rdquo;
states that ordinarily the dead are cremated, warriors only being
buried. I have never heard of any clan in these hills which cremates
its dead. The custom may well have died out owing to the natural wish
of the relatives to do honour to the deceased by according him the
honours of a warrior. Lieutenant Stewart describes a regular marriage
ceremony conducted by the headman of the village, at the foot of a
large stone erected in the middle of the village. As far as my
enquiries go, the marriage ceremonies differ very little from those of
the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">The dress of the men is the same as among the Lushais,
but the women wear a petticoat with a broad white line between two
narrower blue ones, and dress their hair in a long plait wound round
the head. Zawlbuks are not maintained, but in other respects their
villages resemble those of the Lushais. The village organisation is
more democratic, the chief being replaced by a headman. The honours of
&ldquo;Thangchhuah&rdquo; and admission to Pial-ral are obtained by
three times celebrating the Buh-ai festival. There is no restriction as
to having windows.</p>
<p class="par">When a young man wishes to marry he sends messengers
bearing a blue and a white cloth, a hoe, and a pot of liquor to the
<span class="corr" id="xd24e6903" title=
"Source: girls&rsquo;">girl&rsquo;s</span> parents. This is called
&ldquo;In hawn.&rdquo; If the articles are accepted the marriage takes
place as soon as the necessary amount of zu can be prepared. The
bride&rsquo;s parents kill a pig and the two families feast together.
The girl is conveyed to her husband&rsquo;s house by the men who
arranged the marriage, the party being pelted with dirt as among the
Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">In case of adultery, it is the seducer, not the
woman&rsquo;s relatives, who have to compensate the injured husband.
This is the common rule among non-Lushei clans.</p>
<p class="par">A boy is named seven days and a girl five days after
birth, a red cock being killed and zu drunk. The maternal uncle gives
the name. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In common with many Old Kuki clans, the dead are buried
in a special cemetery outside the village. The corpse of a
&ldquo;Thangchhuah,&rdquo; dressed in fine cloths and the head adorned
with a chaplet of the tail feathers of the hornbill, is carried round
the village on a bier by all the old people of both sexes, encircled by
a ring of dancers singing a dirge to the accompaniment of drums, and
followed by the widow dressed in the scantiest rags and raising loud
lamentations. A halt is called opposite the house of every person of
importance, and the inmate is expected to regale the party with zu. The
circuit of the village completed, the corpse is carried to the grave
and buried with rice and other eatables and a flagon of zu. A rough
representation of a house is built over the grave and food and drink
are placed in it for a year. The grave is fenced round and the heads of
any animals which have been killed in the deceased&rsquo;s honour are
placed on posts. At the close of a year a cane is stretched between
poles over the grave, and from it are suspended pieces of cloth, small
baskets containing tobacco and linseed, and the bodies of small animals
and birds. This is the final ceremony, and the spirit is supposed to
have no further concern with this world.</p>
<p class="par">The Biate in the Lushai Hills worship the images in the
Bhuban caves, but I am told that those in the North Cachar Hills differ
in this respect. The three images are called Bolawng Raia, Chhinga
Raia, and Maituki Raia, Raia being a corruption of Rajah. A fowl, a
pig, two eggs, and two kinds of jungle vegetable called
&ldquo;chinghrut&rdquo; and &ldquo;hruitung&rdquo; are offered to these
deities outside the village once a year. The following tale is told to
account for this worship of images, which is so opposed to general
custom:&mdash;Long ago Zatea stole a mithan belonging to two Biate
chiefs, Chonlut and Manlal, and on their trying to recover their
property they were severely wounded. On their way home they noticed
that the leaves of the &ldquo;bung&rdquo; tree, a species of
<i>Ficus</i>, attached themselves to their clothes, and at night they
dreamt that the leaves spoke, saying, &ldquo;Do not throw us away; we
are sent by the gods of the Bhuban caves to heal you.&rdquo; They
applied the leaves to their wounds and were soon healed, and then set
off in search of these new gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6918src"
href="#xd24e6918" name="xd24e6918src">3</a> It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>is
probable that in the course of their wanderings the Biate at one time
lived near the Bhuban, and in that case their adopting the figures as
local deities is quite in keeping with what has happened in other
clans. Thus the Chiru worship the god of Kobru, though their settlement
near that hill is of recent date. The Zote, a clan very closely allied
to the Biate, after sacrificing a mithan, place bung leaves in a basket
at the foot of the memorial post and throw them away with the
&ldquo;sherh&rdquo; after three days. This clan pays special honour to
Chhura, and after a mithan sacrifice a knotched pole called
Chhura&rsquo;s ladder is placed against the gable of the house, and the
skull, tail, and entrails are placed over it for three days. The
jawbones are hung on a branch specially left for this purpose when the
memorial post is being trimmed; a rough fence is made round the posts,
on which matting representations of pythons and a bow with an arrow
adjusted are hung. The latter is said to drive off the Huai, and
reminds one of the similar custom of the Manipuris on the occasion of
erecting the first post of a house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE THADO CLAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The term New Kukis, which appears so often in the
records of Cachar and Sylhet in the middle of the last century, and
which has been adopted by Dr. Grierson in the &ldquo;Linguistic Survey
of India,&rdquo; may be taken as synonymous with the Thado clan. The
clan is a very large one; Dr. Grierson in the &ldquo;Linguistic
Survey&rdquo; estimates the numbers as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellTop">In Manipur</td>
<td class="xd24e3457 cellRight cellTop">20,000.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft">In Naga Hills</td>
<td class="xd24e3457 cellRight">5,500.</td>

<td class="xd24e3457 cellRight cellBottom"><span class=
"sum">31,437.</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This estimate omits the members of the clan in North
Cachar Hills and in the unadministered tracts between the Naga Hills
and Manipur on the west and the Upper Chindwin district of Burma on the
east. Allowing for these, we may safely conclude that the clan now
numbers about 37,000 souls.</p>
<p class="par">The clan is divided in a manner exactly similar to the
Lushei. There are four main families, all named after their
progenitors, and these are further sub-divided into many eponymous
branches. The whole clan traces its genealogy back to Thado and his
elder brother Dongel, and beyond them to mythical heroes who lived
below the surface of the ground. The late Colonel McCulloch, in his
most interesting &ldquo;Account of the Valley of Manipur,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;About the names of those previous to Thado there may be some
doubt, but from this great chief, from whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>the
whole race takes the appellation of Thado, I don&rsquo;t think that
there is any.&rdquo; After many enquiries I am quite of the same
opinion and have found pedigrees collected from various sources differ
but slightly from that recorded by Colonel McCulloch fifty years ago.
The original habitation of this clan is said to have been Kochuk,
situated very far to the south of Manipur. Here I must differ from
Colonel McCulloch, who says the traditional home of the Thados was in
the north. There are other reasons besides tradition for believing that
the Thados have come from the south, the many resemblances between them
and other clans, which either still live in the centre of the Hills or
did so till quite recently, and the connection between their language
and those of the Sokte, Siyin, Vuite, and Ralte, so clearly established
by Dr. Grierson, amply proves the southern origin of this clan. It
appears almost certain that the Kamhaus, Soktes, and Siyins were the
first to disturb the Thados, many of whom entered Manipur territory to
escape from these active foes, while others probably moved westward and
settled in the hills to the south of the Cachar district, whence in
1848&ndash;50 they were driven into Cachar by the triumphant Lushais,
as described in <a href="#ch1.1.3">Part I., Chapter I, para. 3</a>. In
the Manipuri chronicle there is mention of an expedition against the
Khongjais, as the Manipuris call the Thados, as early as 1787, and
though the chronicle cannot be accepted as infallible, I think we may
conclude that the Thados entered the Manipur Hills about the middle of
the 18th century. The different families seem very soon to have
separated and, just as among the Lusheis, to have fought among
themselves, for tradition speaks of a great battle between the
Shit-hloh and the Chhinchhuan, on the Sawnchal hill, some 60 miles in
an air-line south-east of Imphal, the capital of Manipur.</p>
<p class="par">The four main families are the Dongel, Shit-hloh,
Haukip, and Kipgen. The Dongel are descended from Thado&rsquo;s elder
brother, and therefore are considered as rather superior to the rest of
the families. The reason why the clan has not been known by the name of
Dongel is said to be that Thado was a far greater warrior and killed
more men. His name is derived, by the people themselves, from
&ldquo;th&#257;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;to kill,&rdquo; and &ldquo;doh,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to war.&rdquo; It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>is curious that the direct
descendants of Thado are known as Shit-hloh. This Shit-hloh was the
seventh in the direct line from Thado, and it is said that up till his
time the followers of the direct line had been fewer than those of the
Kipgen and Haukip, but Shit-hloh was great in council and war, and
retrieved the fortunes of his family, and hence his name has been
adopted by them. Thus Thado remains as the true clan name, while
Shit-hloh, Kipgen, and Haukip are the names of the families, which are
further subdivided, as among the Lushais, into many branches, mostly
named eponymously. The Kipgen and Haukip have always differed slightly
from the Shit-hloh. The reason given for this is that Thalun, the son
of Thado, was one day sitting outside his house with his wife, and,
being alone together, the lady was somewhat careless as to her
garments. Hearing some people approaching, Thalun told her to adjust
her dress, and as she did not at once comply he threw a piece of wood
at her and killed her on the spot. Being overcome with grief and shame,
he fled to another part of the country and married again, the second
wife being the mother of Kipgen and Haukip, whereas Elmun, from whom
the Shit-hloh claim descent, was the son of the ill-fated first
wife.</p>
<p class="par">The number of branches into which these three families
have divided is very great, and the connection of all of them with the
parent stem is not very well established. Most of them are now of but
little importance, the members being much scattered, but the
Chhinchhuan, a branch of the Shit-hloh, and Chongput and Hawlthang,
both branches of the Haukip family, still are of some importance. The
Chhinchhuan chiefs rule over eleven villages, containing 952 houses, in
the southern portion of the Manipur Hills, where they have been
established certainly over 150 years. The Chongput and Hawlthang chiefs
occupy sites in the hills to the west of the Manipur valley, which were
assigned to them by Colonel McCulloch about 1850, and rule over some
190 houses.</p>
<p class="par">With the exception of the three branches just mentioned,
the Thados have broken up very much, and are found in small hamlets
scattered about the territory of totally different clans, without any
reference to locality or ethnographical considerations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">All members of these families, however, admit the claims
of the head chief to their allegiance, and in token thereof give him,
or his nearest representative, a hind leg of every wild animal
killed.</p>
<p class="par">The Thados generally are very truculent; in Manipur they
have settled themselves among the more peaceable Nagas, and until the
British Government assumed control of the State they lived largely on
the labour of these unfortunate people, whom they had virtually reduced
to slaves. The Manipuris found it easier to acquiesce in this
oppression by the Thados than to coerce them, and the Thados were used
on many occasions to punish Naga tribes whom the Manipuris were unable
to reduce to submission. The superior cunning of the Manipuris enabled
them to maintain their influence over the Thados by skilfully playing
off one family against another. On one occasion three of the most
powerful chiefs were enticed inside the royal enclosure in Imphal and
treacherously murdered. At present large numbers of Thados are moving
eastward in unadministered country, carrying on the same bullying
tactics, reducing the inhabitants, who as yet have no firearms, to the
condition of slaves.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Thados are found the remnants of many other
clans, which have been practically absorbed, having adopted Thado
customs and language. It is asserted that at the time of the Thimzing
(<i>v.</i> <a href="#ch1.5.1">Part I., Chap. V, para. 1</a>) Lianthang
and his brother Thlangom, and Lunkim and his brother Changsan, had such
large supplies of skulls of animals killed by them that they were
enabled to live through that trying time by using the trophies of their
skill in the chase as fuel, and from them the present Lianthang,
Thlangom, Lunkim, and Changsan clans claim descent. The Changsan are
sub-divided into eight families and are considered a clan of some
standing, as is shown by the fact that the Shit-hloh will only take
wives from Shit-hloh, Changsan, and Mangyel households.</p>
<p class="par">The following clans are said not to be descended from
Thado, but to have emerged from the earth after the
Thimzing:&mdash;Kulho, Shongte, Kullon, Th&#257;ngneo, H&#257;nngeng,
Henng&#257;r, and Thanchhing. They are now to all intents and purposes
Thados, most of them having even adopted the Sakhua, or domestic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>sacrificial rites, of whichever family of the
Thado clan they have attached themselves to. Shongte and his younger
brother Kullon emerged from the Khulpi, which is the Thado equivalent
of the Lushai Chhinglung. Kulho, Th&#257;ngneo, and H&#257;nngeng were
sons of Shongte, the two latter being by a different mother to the
first. Henng&#257;r was Kulho&rsquo;s son. Kulho celebrated the Chong
festival, and invited his half-brothers, but Th&#257;ngneo refused to
come, so Kulho disowned him, which angered Th&#257;ngneo, so that he
proposed to H&#257;nngeng that they should kill Kulho, but
H&#257;nngeng refused, saying that the removal of Kulho would make
Th&#257;ngneo head of the family, but would in no way benefit him. This
ancient quarrel is sometimes revived even now, and blows are exchanged
when representatives of Kulho and Th&#257;ngneo meet round the
zu-pot.</p>
<p class="par">The houses of the Thados generally resemble those of the
Lushais, but are less regular in their interior arrangements, a big
house sometimes having two or three hearths irregularly placed.
Zawlbuks are not built, the young men sleeping in the houses of
well-to-do people. The houses of the chiefs are surrounded by
palisading enclosing a courtyard, along one side of which there is
often a platform, which reminds one very much of the Chin houses, and
is one of the many trifles tending to confirm the tradition of the
southern origin of the clan. The following extracts from Lieut.
Stewart&rsquo;s notes on Northern Cachar, written in 1855, show us the
Thados as he knew them:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Each of the four clans is divided into separate
and independent Rajahlics, of greater or less power and numbers,
consisting of one or more villages, each of which is presided over by a
hereditary chief or Rajah, whose power is supreme, and who has a civil
list as long, in proportion to the means of his subjects, as that
possessed by any other despot in the world. All these Rajahs are
supposed to have sprung from the same stock, which it is believed
originally had connection with the gods themselves. Their persons are,
therefore, looked upon with the greatest respect and almost
superstitious veneration, and their commands are in every case law.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The revenue exacted by these chieftains is paid
in kind and labour. In the former each able-bodied man pays annually
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>a basket of rice containing about two maunds;
out of each brood of pigs or fowls reared in the village, one of the
young becomes the property of the Rajah, and he is further entitled to
one quarter of every animal killed in the chase, and, in addition, to
one of the tusks of each elephant so slain. In labour his entire
population are bound to devote four days in each year, in a body, for
the purpose of cultivating his private fields. On the first day they
cut down the jungle, on the second day, the fuel being dry, they fire
it and prepare the ground, on the third they sow and harrow, and on the
fourth cut and bring in the harvest. Besides the labour of these four
days in which the entire effective population, men, women, and
children, work for him, small parties are told off during the whole
season to assist his own domestic slaves in tending the crop, repairing
his house (which edifice is always built afresh by the subjects when a
new site is repaired to), and in supplying wood and water for the
family. On the occasion of the days of general labour, a great feast is
given by the Rajah to all his people; so also, on the occasion of an
elephant being killed, to the successful hunters, but this is the only
remuneration ever received by them, and calls can be made on them for
further supplies and labour, whenever it may be required.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Rajah is the sole and supreme authority in
the village or villages under him, no one else being competent to give
orders or inflict punishment except through him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To assist him in carrying on the affairs of
government the Rajah has a minister, and more frequently several,
called &lsquo;th&#363;shois&rsquo; or &lsquo;muntries,&rsquo; who have
the privilege of being exempt from labour and taxation at his hands.
This office is not, strictly speaking, hereditary&mdash;although in
most cases, except when thoroughly incompetent, the son succeeds the
father&mdash;but is given to those qualified for it, as being men of
property and influence as well as of ability, and good spokesmen. The
Rajah himself is, on the contrary, invariably succeeded by his eldest
son, for whom, should he be a minor, the kingdom is managed by a
council of muntries. In default of sons, the Rajah&rsquo;s brother
succeeds, and failing him the nearest male relative takes the guddee,
the Salique law being in full force.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Should the Rajah die without any heir to the
throne, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>chief muntry, if he be an influential man, takes
his place, or some neighbouring Rajah of the same clan is called upon
to take the government or usurps it. Each of the clans have one great
Rajah, supposed to be the main branch of the original stock, to whom,
although those immediately beyond his own villages owe him no
allegiance, great respect is shown by all, and acknowledgment of the
superior title given, although in power and wealth he may be much
poorer than others of the tribe.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No regular courts are held among the Kookis, but
complaints are always heard before the Rajah, assisted by his muntries,
whenever they may be made. Heinous crimes are very infrequent among
these people. Theft is almost unknown, and they chiefly offend in
slight quarrels and disputes among themselves, which are settled by
their Rajah, a fine being exacted from the guilty party, according to
his means and the extent of his guilt, either in wine, fowls, pigs,
goats, cows, or methins. When cases of theft, burglary, or arson occur,
the criminal loses his independence and becomes a bondman to the Rajah
for the term of his life. Cases of murder and manslaughter are of
course taken up by our authorities and punished by our laws. But the
punishment awarded for murder among the Kookis was confiscation of all
goods and property and perpetual bondage for the murderer, his wife,
and family, who thenceforth became slaves of the Rajah and did his
work. The only crime punishable by death among the Kookis was high
treason, or an attempt at violence on the person of the king, and
treacherous commerce with an enemy of the clan: the victim in these
cases was cut to pieces with dhaos, but of course no such extreme
measures can be resorted to by them in the present day. In cases of
adultery and seduction the punishment is left in the hands of the
aggrieved husband or father. In the former case, death might be
inflicted on the adulterer by any means with impunity, but more
generally it was, and now invariably is, the custom to compound with
him for a large sum of money, something over and above the original
price of the wife. The adulteress then becomes the property of her
lover.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In cases of seduction every effort is made, and
in most cases <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>successfully, to have the guilty couple married
forthwith, a penal price being put upon the bride. All the women in the
village, married or single, are perfectly at the pleasure of the Rajah,
and no voice would be lifted against him for cohabiting with any of
them, the only prevention being a sense of immorality and an
understanding among the royal families of the whole tribe generally
that such conduct is <i>infra dig.</i>; indeed, there is little
temptation, for the Rajah may have as many wives as he likes or can
keep, both polygamy and concubinage being in common practice, female
slaves living generally in the latter condition with respect to their
masters.&rdquo;&mdash;Stewart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes on Northern
Cachar,&rdquo; pp. 45&ndash;48.</p>
<p class="par">This description is still fairly accurate, but the
gradual breaking up of villages, coupled with the increased control by
Government and State officers, has lessened the power of the chiefs and
modified custom to a considerable extent. Lieutenant Stewart gives the
following account of how the people hunted before guns were common
among them:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Kookis are great hunters, and are
passionately fond of the sport, looking upon it, next to war, as the
noblest exercise for man. They kill tigers, deer, and smaller game by
means of poisoned arrows. The bow is a small one made of bamboo, and
very slightly bent, the string being manufactured of bark. The arrow,
the head of which has a barbed iron point, is about 18 inches long,
being drawn to the chest and not the ear, and therefore delivered with
no great force, the destructive effect lying chiefly in the poison.
With such an instrument the great art in hunting lies in stealthily
approaching the animal near enough to deliver the arrow with effect,
and in following it up after being wounded to the spot where it is
found lying dead. In this the Kookis excel, being able to prowl about
the jungle as noiselessly as tiger-cats, and being equal to North
American Indians in distinguishing tracks. Tigers are also killed by
spring bows with poisoned arrows set in the jungles and by poisoned
panjies planted in their paths.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elephants are slain in great numbers by the
Kookis wherever they are to be had, not only the tusks but the flesh
being highly prized. Parties of 20 and upwards go out in pursuit of
them at a time<span class="corr" id="xd24e7029" title=
"Not in source">.</span> When some recent elephant track is discovered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>in the forest, two or three of the party ascend
some convenient tree, whose branches overhang the track, the remainder
follow it up, and having got on the other side of the herd scare it
towards the ambush by shouting, beating gongs, and discharging
firearms. Here, while passing, the animals are assailed from above with
long spears having huge iron barbs covered with deadly poison; every
wound inflicted results in the death of the animal at not more than
half a mile from the spot on which he was hit. So wary are the
elephants, however, that it is seldom that more than two out of a herd
are killed. At the place where their game is found dead, they commence
cutting him up, and extract his tusks; laden with these and as much of
the flesh as they can carry, they return home, and other parties go out
and encamp in the neighbourhood of the carcase until they have entirely
consumed it, or are driven away by the effluvia of decomposition.
Portions of the flesh that they cannot immediately eat are dried and
smoked to be kept for future consumption. The Kookis also hunt the
methin or wild cow, which they have likewise succeeded in
domesticating, having introduced the breed to Northern Cachar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The deadly poison used by the Kookis is, they
say, extracted from a tree which does not grow in these parts, but the
article is brought to them for sale by tribes inhabiting the borders of
Manipur. The substance is of a dark blue or black colour and of about
the consistency of common resin. To make it serviceable it is ground
down with capsicum seeds and tobacco juice, so as to form a pulp, with
which the weapons are smeared, cotton soaked in the mixture being also
tied to the iron under the barb. I had once the cruelty to try the
effect of this poison on two domestic fowls. To one I administered
internally a dose equal to about two common-sized pills, and I
punctured one of the legs of the other, so as merely to draw blood,
with the pointed bamboo about the size of a toothpick which had been
dipped into the mixture. The latter died in twenty minutes without much
apparent pain, and in the former no effects whatever could be
perceived, and it may be crowing to the present day. Another poison,
called &lsquo;deo-bi,&rsquo; is used by the Kookis to kill fish, and
has an intoxicating effect upon them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>forcing them to the
surface, when it is thrown into the water. The Kookis also spear fish,
but have not much idea of catching them by the hook or
net.&rdquo;&mdash;Stewart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes on Northern
Cachar,&rdquo; pp. 62, 63.</p>
<p class="par">When the track of a tiger is found the
&ldquo;thempu&rdquo; lifts the earth on which the footprint is and lays
it on a leaf of the &ldquo;ai&rdquo; plant. He pours some zu on it and
then, muttering charms, he wraps it up in the leaf and drops it into a
pot, which he places to his ear and professes to be able to hear
whether the pursuit of the animal will be crowned with success. The
customs as regards &ldquo;boi&rdquo; approximate to those of the
Lushais, and where they differ it is always to the disadvantage of the
boi; thus a criminal seeking refuge in the chief&rsquo;s house has to
pay a mithan before he can be accepted. On a chief&rsquo;s death each
boi has to kill a pig at his funeral. Slavery by purchase is recognised
and is not restricted to the chiefs&mdash;another point of resemblance
between the Thados and the Chins.</p>
<p class="par">The village organisation is much the same as among the
Lushais, but the minor chiefs, while collecting all dues from the
people of their villages, pay certain dues to the head of their family.
The crier is known as &ldquo;tl&#257;ngsam,&rdquo; but he receives no
remuneration. The &ldquo;thirdeng,&rdquo; or blacksmith, is known as
&ldquo;thirshu,&rdquo; and receives a day&rsquo;s labour from every
householder in the village as his pay.</p>
<p class="par">The thempu only receives zu, and this only from those he
cures&mdash;a system tending to increase the skill of the
practitioners.</p>
<p class="par">As regards marriage the rules are not very clearly
defined, but young men of the families which sacrifice a sow to their
Sakhua will not generally take girls from the families which sacrifice
a mithan. Strange to say, the sow-sacrificers have no objection to
providing brides for the mithan-slayers, the cause probably being that
in certain cases the wife&rsquo;s Sakhua has to be propitiated and the
cautious sons of sow-killing families object to the extra expense
involved by marrying a wife whose Sakhua demands a mithan. Lieutenant
Stewart states that strict rules existed prohibiting the intermarriage
of cousins, however remote, but my enquiries tend to show that at
present the prohibition only extends to paternal cousins to the third
generation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Marriage is by purchase, the sums to be paid
being:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Manpi&rdquo; (Lushai
&ldquo;manpui&rdquo;)&mdash;three to 30 mithan, according to the family
of the bride, to the father of the girl or his representative.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Golha&rdquo; (Lushai
&ldquo;palal&rdquo;)&mdash;Rs. 4/- or 5/-.</p>
<p class="par">The bride&rsquo;s elder sister, one cloth of dark
blue.</p>
<p class="par">The father&rsquo;s younger brother, one mithan, called
&ldquo;mankang,&rdquo; but if he is living in the same house as the
father then the nearest male relative who is living separately receives
this.</p>
<p class="par">Although a man has paid the full price for his wife, yet
he has, on her death and the death of each of her sons, to pay a
further sum called &ldquo;longman&rdquo; to her nearest male relative.
Supposing Pathong marries Thonghlu&rsquo;s daughter and has by her two
sons, one of whom dies, it is Thonghlu&rsquo;s duty to kill a pig in
honour of the deceased and to take the skull and all the flesh except
that of the head and the entrails to Pathong. The skull is placed over
the grave and the flesh eaten by the family. Pathong now has to pay
Thonghlu the price of the pig and Rs. 9/-, but if he prefers he may,
instead of these two sums, give one mithan, however small, Rs. 1/-, and
a hoe. It is often found cheaper to give the mithan. Suppose Thonghlu
is now gathered to his fathers, leaving a son, Kanpu, and
Pathong&rsquo;s wife also dies, then Kanpu must kill the pig and will
receive the mithan. Pathong departs this life and his son marries and
begets a son, Komyang, and Kanpu also dies leaving a son, Nelet. Now on
the death of Pathong&rsquo;s remaining son, Nelet must kill the pig and
will receive the mithan from the dead man&rsquo;s son, Komyang, and as
this extinguishes the liability on account of Thonghlu&rsquo;s
daughter, Komyang, in token thereof, will also give to Nelet one spear
and one tinder-box. These payments, unfortunately, are seldom made on
the spot, and claims on account of great-aunts or even more distant
female relatives are frequently brought up for decision. In case of
women who die in childbed or in any unnatural manner her
&ldquo;longman,&rdquo; as this payment is called, has not to be paid.
&ldquo;Longman&rdquo; reminds one of the Lushai &ldquo;lukawng,&rdquo;
and very similar customs are found among the Old Kuki and some Naga
clans.</p>
<p class="par">In common with nearly all non-Lushei clans, a Thado
co-respondent, and not his victim&rsquo;s relatives, has to pay the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>injured husband all the expenses he had incurred
in the marriage and also a fine of one mithan. The same rule applies to
the seducer of a widow living in her late husband&rsquo;s house. On a
man&rsquo;s death his eldest brother can insist on marrying the widow
and taking all the children. &ldquo;Sawnman&rdquo; is enforced as among
the Lushais, but should the father refuse to take the child when it is
old enough to leave its mother, he is called on to pay a second mithan,
and he forfeits the right to receive the marriage price in case of a
girl. The eldest son inherits and, failing a son, the nearest male
relative. Adoption is practised as among the Lushais, the ceremony
being known as &ldquo;Phunkai&rdquo; (Lushai
&ldquo;S&#257;-phun&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="par">In case of accidental homicide the offender has to kill
a pig at his victim&rsquo;s funeral and provide a blue cloth to wrap
the body in. Should the death have been caused by a gunshot wound the
gun is forfeited to the heir of the deceased. The Thados claim that
rape and sodomy are unknown among them.</p>
<p class="par">There is no doubt that head-hunting was indulged in in
olden days, and on the death of a powerful chief at least one freshly
taken head had to adorn his grave.</p>
<p class="par">Lieutenant Stewart, in the book already quoted from,
gives a good deal of information about the religious beliefs of the
Thados. He says they recognise one all-powerful god, whom they call
Pathen (Lushai Pathian), who has a wife, Nongjai. I have enquired about
Pathen&rsquo;s wife, but though all my informants say that it is usual
to speak of Pathen Nongjai together, none could say whether Nongjai was
Pathen&rsquo;s wife&mdash;an equally powerful being, sharing power with
Pathen&mdash;or simply another name for Pathen. Stewart also provides
Pathen with a son, Thihla, but my informants all agree that the Thihla
are demons of the hills, rivers, and forests&mdash;in other words
exactly the same as the Huais of the Lushais. Ghumoishe, mentioned by
Stewart, is the king of all these Thihla, and he has a wife, Imungshe.
They are supposed to inhabit the densest forests on the highest
mountain tops, and when passing through such their dread names are
never mentioned. About this demon Stewart says: &ldquo;By some he is
said to be the illegitimate son of Pathen, but others deny the
relationship, and say that he has no connection with the god
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>whatever. The idea of making the origin of evil
proceed thus from an illegitimate source is exceedingly clever.&rdquo;
None of my informants would venture a guess even at Ghumoishe&rsquo;s
parentage. Kuchom, whom Stewart gives as Ghumoishe&rsquo;s wife, is
nowadays, as far as I can find out, unknown, as also is Hilo, said by
Stewart to be the daughter of the last-named couple and to be the
goddess of poisons. The Thihla are divided into Thingbulnga, the Thihla
of the big trees; Shongbulnga, of the rocks and stones; Tuikhumnga, the
demons of the water, of whom Tuikhumlen is the king. These water
spirits are said to be far more powerful than those of the woods or
rocks, and therefore are often spoken of as Tui-pathen. They also
receive a fourfold sacrifice, of a white fowl or an egg, a pig, a dog,
which must not be entirely black, and a he-goat, whereas cocks or hens
are considered quite good enough for the Thingbulgna or
Shongbulgna.</p>
<p class="par">Zomi is a female spectre, a sight of which is a sure
forerunner of some dire misfortune, which can only be averted by the
immediate sacrifice of a dog. Pheizam correspond to the L&#257;shi.
Nuaijingmang is an evil spirit which lives underground.</p>
<p class="par">After death the spirits of men and women, great and
small, all go to Mi-thi-khua. The only advantage which the spirits of
those who have slain men and beasts and given feasts obtain is that
Kulsamnu does not dare to detain them, whereas she, sitting by the
roadside, seizes all other poor wandering souls, and troubles them
sorely unless their relatives who have gone on before come to their
rescue.</p>
<p class="par">I have been unable to find any traces of ancestor
worship, nor is it mentioned either by Stewart or McCulloch. This is
extremely curious, as the Thados attach the highest possible importance
to a long pedigree and, as has been seen, nearly every other clan
practise some rites to appease the dead.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Religious Rites and Sacrifices.</i>&mdash;The Daibawl
sacrifices are made as among the Lushais, but not the Kh&#257;l. The
Dongel and Shit-hloh families sacrifice a sow to Sakhua, but the Haukip
and Kipgen kill a mithan. This difference is said to date back to the
time when the Haukip lived on the banks of the Run or Manipur river,
near to Tiddim, and sacrificed a mithan to Rulpui<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e7082" title="Source: .">,</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>or the great snake.
The Chhinchhuan are said to have recently adopted the Vaiphei method of
propitiating Sakhua, and in consequence the Shit-hloh have ceased
intermarrying with them.</p>
<p class="par">Besides the sacrifice to Sakhua the Thado have a special
sacrifice known as &ldquo;Pathen biak na&rdquo; (&ldquo;speaking to
Pathen&rdquo;). This consists of killing a small pig in the closet at
the end of the house and a white cock in front of the house. The crop,
entrails, and bones are &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; and are placed on an oaken
post in front of the house, and a thirty days&rsquo;
&ldquo;hrilh&rdquo; is observed.</p>
<p class="par">The Ai ceremonies are much the same as among the
Lushais, but in that of the tiger the carrying of the porcupine is
unknown. Directly a tiger is shot a bamboo skewer is hammered into its
ear hole, to make sure that it is dead, and when the body is brought up
to the village an egg is placed in the mouth by some female relative of
the lucky hunter, who addresses the dead animal thus: &ldquo;Oh! Ho!
You stole that, did you? And so a peg has been driven into your
ear.&rdquo; She then jumps across the body from side to side and from
head to tail. After this the skin may be removed. In connection with
cultivation, a ceremony called &ldquo;Daibun&rdquo; is performed after
the burning of the jhums. Seven bamboos adorned with cotton wool are
placed round the jhum as an offering to the &ldquo;Thihla&rdquo; of the
locality, who are further propitiated later on by an offering of an egg
and some leaves placed on a bamboo in the middle of the jhum. This is
called &ldquo;Daikam.&rdquo; Wanolnaunu died because she was so lazy
that it was too much trouble to live, so if any of her signs are found
in a new jhum, a sacrifice has to be performed to avoid a failure of
the crops. A tree which has two trunks which unite some feet above the
ground is said to represent her fingers, and a red fowl must be
sacrificed and the tree dug up by the roots. A spring is said to be her
tears, and a goat must be sacrificed. If a wallow is found a pig must
be offered. If a woman is not blessed with offspring within the usual
time of the marriage there are three methods of procedure:&mdash;The
woman may go to her father&rsquo;s house, and he will kill a cock and
they will drink zu together, after which he ties a string round her
neck. If this is not successful she may go to her husband&rsquo;s
eldest brother or cousin, and he will repeat the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>performance. If there is still no result the
thempu is called in and kills a black hen inside the house, and its
flesh, mixed with stones and other ingredients, is compounded by him
into a medicine which the poor woman desirous of offspring has to eat.
On the occasion of the birth of a child the mother may not leave her
house for five days in case of a son and three in case of a daughter.
When these periods have expired she goes to her father&rsquo;s house
and takes a fowl or a pig, according to her means. This is called
&ldquo;Nau-bil-vu.&rdquo; The mother also gives her father or sometimes
her mother a cloth on the occasion of the birth of a child, and the
recipient kills a pig in honour of the occasion. In case of a child
getting sick the thempu sacrifices a fowl, called
&ldquo;Ar-kang-tha.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The marriage ceremonies of the Thados are described by
both McCulloch and Stewart, and do not seem to have changed at all
during the 55 years that have elapsed since their accounts were
written. Neither account, however, is quite complete. The bridegroom,
accompanied by his friends, taking with them at any rate a portion of
the sum to be paid for the bride, go to the village where the girl
lives, and for three days the young men of the village wrestle with
them. On arrival they are met with showers of filth from the children
of the village. The girl&rsquo;s parents have to give a pig or a mithan
and much zu to celebrate the occasion. At the conclusion of the feast
the bride sets out for her future home dressed in her best and wearing
a gong on her head. The actual marriage ceremony takes place in the
house of the father of the bridegroom and consists of the thempu
killing a fowl, feathers from the right wing being placed in the hair
of the young couple. They then drink out of the same cup of zu, and the
thempu, muttering charms, binds a cotton thread round their necks,
which must be worn till it falls off from old age.</p>
<p class="par">The thempu then presents each with a comb. Only very
near relatives may use the same comb. Stewart says husband and wife may
share a comb, but my information is that uterine brothers and sisters
may do so. A Lushai correspondent writes that among them the use of
another man&rsquo;s comb may cause a headache, and that a person of a
higher clan would be contaminated if he used the comb of a member
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>of a lower one. To see whether the union will
prove harmonious the thempu takes a hair from the head of each and
moistens them in zu and then twists them together. If the hairs remain
twisted all will go smoothly, but should they fly apart many bickerings
and disputes are to be expected. The parents of the bridegroom give a
feast to all concerned, and this completes the ceremony, but the young
couple do not at once commence sleeping together. If they have not been
previously acquainted they often sleep apart for a month, and for
lesser periods according to the degree of their acquaintance.</p>
<p class="par">Eligible brides are even now carried off and married
against the wishes of their parents, by ardent lovers belonging to
powerful families.</p>
<p class="par">Immediately a death occurs guns are fired and a special
funeral chant called &ldquo;L&#257; pi&rdquo; (Lushai
&ldquo;Hl&#257;&rdquo;) is sung three times. The funeral ceremonies of
ordinary people are practically the same as among the Lushais, but in
the case of those who have performed the &ldquo;Chong&rdquo; the
ceremonies last seven days, and each day the corpse is carried in and
out of the house seven times with much shouting, and a mithan has to be
killed on each day. Every relative and slave has to attend and bring
some animal to be killed. The skulls of all these adorn the great
man&rsquo;s grave, and, in former days, at least one fresh human skull
taken specially for the occasion from some other clan had to be added
to the other trophies over a chief&rsquo;s grave. Sometimes the body of
a great chief may be placed in a small house at a short distance from
the village and partially dried over a slow fire; and a curious
survival of the times of war is found in the practice, now dying out,
of severing the head and burying it in an earthen pot in a separate
place. This was done to prevent the heads being found and removed as
trophies, should the village be raided. The entrails of the first
animal killed in honour of the deceased are placed on leaves at the
foot of the post against which the corpse rested during the funeral
feast, and are left there for several days, even up to one month, and
at every meal a handful of rice is taken out of the pot and placed on
the leaves, before anyone is allowed to eat. This portion for the dead
is called &ldquo;thi an chhe.&rdquo; As among the Rangte, efforts are
made to obtain some wild animal or bird, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>and if the hunters
are successful the entrails of the animal, or the whole animal if it be
not edible, are buried with the &ldquo;thi an chhe&rdquo; in the grave,
without waiting for the expiry of the month.</p>
<p class="par">Unnatural deaths (&ldquo;thichhia&rdquo;) are considered
unlucky, and the custom regarding the disposal of the corpse in such
cases is the same as among the Lushais. Memorial stones are not
generally put up by the Thados, but are occasionally found among the
Chhinchhuan, perhaps from their proximity to the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">A man who has performed the Ai of a tiger is honoured
with a special memorial. Two posts, one some four feet long and the
other about three, carefully squared and with the four sides ornamented
with transverse notches, are placed in the ground some five or six feet
apart. The longer post terminates in a spike, on which are impaled
several oval-shaped pieces of wood, which indicate the number of
animals killed by the deceased. Between the posts and to one side a
long pole is planted leaning over between the posts, and from this
hangs half a dried gourd shell, convex side uppermost, from the rim of
which hang tassels of rough wooden beads, and from the centre hangs a
piece of wood 7 or 8 inches long, of which one end is forked and the
other a knob. This represents &ldquo;thotche,&rdquo; a sort of rat
found in the jungle and said to be the master of the jungle. If this
animal is burnt in the jungle the &ldquo;Thihla&rdquo; of the place
will be angry and punish the persons responsible. Children eat the
flesh of the thotche. The posts are called &ldquo;thingel&rdquo; and
remind one of the memorial posts of the Chins, and the be-tasselled
gourd is a sign among those people that the owner of the house before
which it is displayed has killed a man.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">A woman who has performed the Buh Ai is also honoured
with a special memorial, consisting of an upright stone some three feet
high, in front of which are placed three others supporting a flat
stone. A space of about four square yards in front is enclosed by a
line of stones set on edge, the whole of the interior being planted
with small stones, which are supposed to show the number of baskets of
rice reaped on the occasion of the Ai. The feasts connected with the
cultivation known by the Lushais as &ldquo;Kut&rdquo; are not
practised, but when the rice is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>well up the whole community
goes to the jhums, dancing and singing, and beating drums and gongs. In
the jhums they work vigorously in perfect silence for a considerable
time and then burst forth into song and dance, and eat their fill of
rice washed down with zu. There is another feast connected with the
crops called &ldquo;Hun,&rdquo; which takes place when the rice is
about a foot high. Each household prepares two pots of zu, one for the
husband and one for the wife, and a post called &ldquo;shekhon&rdquo;
is planted before each house. This post has two horizontal arms
projecting, one near the top and one near the ground, the upper one
being the longer. These are perforated, and three reeds are passed
through the holes. Each household kills a white cock at the foot of the
shekhon. The flesh is cooked in the house and eaten by the householder
alone. The &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; and bones are hung on the shekhon. The
zu in the householder&rsquo;s pot may only be drunk by other
householders, but that in the wife&rsquo;s pot is dispensed to all
comers. For five days after this feast no one but members of the
household may enter the house. Nothing out of the house may be given
away, and the householder must do no work, nor may he attend a
funeral.</p>
<p class="par">The series of feasts performed by the Lushais to attain
the honours of &ldquo;Thangchhuah&rdquo; is not customary among the
Thados, though some informants say that in olden days some such custom
prevailed, and the &ldquo;Chong&rdquo; feast, at which seven mithan and
two of every other sort of domestic animal had to be killed, is not
performed now only because none can afford the expense. It will be
remembered that &ldquo;Chong&rdquo; is the name of the first feast in
the Thangchhuah series. Among the Haukip I am told that a position
equivalent to Thangchhuah is attained by thrice celebrating the Ai of
one of the following&mdash;tiger, bear, elephant, or hornbill.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Benglama is the equivalent of the Lushai Chhura,
and there are many tales about him which are common to both clans and
in fact seem to be known to almost all representatives of the
Kuki-Lushai race. The following is a translation of a portion of a tale
written down in Lushai for me, but told by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>Thado. Benglama had visited a village and got
himself much disliked, and everyone was trying to catch
him:&mdash;&ldquo;Once they made a ladder and cut the lower side partly
through and made a great quagmire underneath. Benglama climbed up it,
it broke, and he fell down into the mud. Then a tiger came up.
&lsquo;My friend, if you help me out you may eat me,&rsquo; said
Benglama. Then the tiger pulled him out. Then the tiger&mdash;&lsquo;I
will eat you up,&rsquo; he said. Benglama&mdash;&lsquo;I will just go
and wash myself clean,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Presently I will eat you
up,&rsquo; he said again. Benglama&mdash;&lsquo;I will go and ease
myself,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;otherwise you will dislike my
dung,&rsquo; he said. Where he went to ease himself he cut a cane. The
tiger&mdash;&lsquo;Why do you do that?&rsquo; he asked. Then
Benglama&mdash;&lsquo;It is going to blow and rain like anything,
therefore I am going to tie myself to the stump of a tree,&rsquo; he
said. Then the tiger&mdash;&lsquo;If that is so, tie me up
first,&rsquo; he said. He tied him up. Then he (Benglama) also put a
mallet, that all who passed by might beat the tiger. Benglama went
away. Then the wild-cat came along. The tiger&mdash;&lsquo;My friend,
you and I are just alike; we two are friends, we are
brothers&mdash;undo me,&rsquo; he said. He undid him. Then the wild-cat
left him, going into a pangolin&rsquo;s hole. Then just as he was going
in, the tiger caught him by the foot. &lsquo;What you have got hold of,
that is not me, it is a tree root,&rsquo; he said. The tiger let him
go, but remained watching for him, but the wild-cat always slipped out
at the other side, and was always eating fowls by Benglama&rsquo;s
house. The tiger&mdash;&lsquo;My friend, what is it you are
eating?&rsquo; he said. Then the wild-cat&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, I am only
just eating the bones of my hand,&rsquo; he said. The tiger was always
eating his paw, and it hurt very, very much indeed. Presently the
wild-cat went to the tiger and said to him, &lsquo;If you were to take
a torch and go near to Benglama&rsquo;s house you would be able to
catch some fowls,&rsquo; he said. So the tiger went up, but Benglama
saw him, and heated some water. When it was very hot indeed, he poured
it into a tui-um (bamboo tube for holding water) and threw it over the
tiger. The tiger said, &lsquo;My friend! My friend! I am dying, I am
all burnt up,&rsquo; he said. The wild-cat&mdash;&lsquo;There is a
waterfall some way down stream; if you roll down that you will be
well,&rsquo; he said. He rolled down and so he died.&rdquo;

Top of the Big &ldquo;Bung&rdquo; Tree.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;This Benglama&mdash;his wife was going to
start for the jhum, and she spoke thus to him. To her husband his wife
said, &lsquo;Benglam, when the sun shines through our doorway, cook the
rice, do,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;When the sun shines on the top of the
bung tree in front of our house, then clean the rice and tie up the
goat,&rsquo; she said, and she also left her child with him. His wife
then left him to go to the jhum. Then he, according to his wife&rsquo;s
orders, when the sun shone in the doorway prepared to cook the rice. As
often as he put the pot on the fire it fell off again. Presently the
sun shone on the top of the bung tree. &lsquo;Did my wife say cook the
food on the top of the bung tree?&rsquo; he said. Then saying, &lsquo;I
will clean the rice,&rsquo; he prepared to climb to the top of the bung
tree with the rice, mortar, and pounder, with the goat and the basket
of fowls; but he could not climb up, he kept on falling down again.
Just then his child, being hungry, began to cry and cry. Then Benglama,
saying, &lsquo;Is his <span class="corr" id="xd24e7141" title=
"Source: frontanel">fontanel</span> hurting?&rsquo; pricked it with his
hairpin. Then the child died. Benglama, saying, &lsquo;Has it gone to
sleep?&rsquo; laid it down on the sleeping machan; he did not know that
it was dead. Then his wife came back from the jhum, and Benglama just
before had fallen from the bung tree and was nearly dead, and lay on
the sleeping platform groaning terribly. His wife said, &lsquo;Are you
ill?&rsquo; and he&mdash;&lsquo;Speak! Why, I can hardly speak, I have
fallen from the top of the bung tree and am nearly dead, don&rsquo;t
you know?&rsquo; he said to her. Then she looked at her child; and his
wife&mdash;&lsquo;Our child here is dead; how has it happened?&rsquo;
she said. <span class="corr" id="xd24e7144" title=

dead, its head was hurting and I pricked it; it is just asleep,&rsquo;
he said to her. Then his wife&mdash;&lsquo;It is dead indeed; go and
bury it,&rsquo; she said. Then Benglama wrapped it up in a mat and
carried it over his shoulder, and the body dropped out behind him, and
he placed the mat only in a cave, and on his way back he saw his
child&rsquo;s body. &lsquo;Whose child is this?&rsquo; he said, and
kicked it about with his feet.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">The Story of Ngamboma and
Khuptingi.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Formerly Ngamboma and Khuptingi, before
they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>born, while in their mothers&rsquo; wombs, they
loved each other. When the time for them to be born came near their
mothers&rsquo; bellies pained them. Then if their mothers put their
bellies near to each other they got well. Then the children were born.
In the jhums when they were placed apart in the jhum house while their
mothers were at work they always got together. When they grew bigger
they loved each other, and Ngamboma wanted to marry Khuptingi, but
their fathers and mothers did not think it wise. Then Ngamboma made an
image of Khuptingi in beeswax and tied it to a stump of a tree on the
bank of the stream, and whenever the water rose Khuptingi got ill and
when it went down she got better. Thus it went on for one year. One day
the stream rose and carried away Khuptingi&rsquo;s image, then
Khuptingi died. They placed her body in a dead-house. From the decaying
matter which fell from her body flowers sprang up, and Ngamboma watched
them always. One day a wild cat was going to take away those flowers,
but Ngamboma caught it and said, &lsquo;Why did you think to steal my
flowers&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just kill you?&rsquo; he said. Then the wild
cat&mdash;&lsquo;Protector! Do not kill me; I am sent by
Khuptingi,&rsquo; he said. Then Ngamboma&mdash;&lsquo;Where is
Khuptingi, then?&rsquo; he said. Then the wild cat&mdash;&lsquo;If you
catch hold of my tail we will both go (to her),&rsquo; he said. Then
the wild cat towed him to the village in which Khuptingi was in the
sky, in Mi-thi-khua (the dead-people&rsquo;s-village), and they arrived
at Khuptingi&rsquo;s house and they slept there, and they ate rice also
together. When they slept together Khuptingi was only bare bones, and
Ngamboma said, &lsquo;What bones are these?<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e7155" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> and he threw them to
the top of the wall and to the bottom of the wall (<i>i.e.</i>, all
about the room). Then the next day Khuptingi&mdash;&lsquo;I am not
well,&rsquo; she said. Ngamboma&mdash;&lsquo;What is the reason?&rsquo;
he said. The Khuptingi&mdash;&lsquo;Last night when I was sleeping near
you you threw me to the top of the wall and to the bottom of the wall;
for that reason I am in pain,&rsquo; she said. Then their villagers
said, &lsquo;Let us go and fish,&rsquo; they said. They went. The place
where they caught fish&mdash;indeed it was not a stream, it was a patch
of bamboo. The dead called the bamboo leaves fish, and they filled
their baskets cram-full, but Ngamboma said to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>himself, &lsquo;They will stop the holes in the
baskets with the leaves when they come to the stream so that the fish
may not fall out by accident,&rsquo; he said, and he stopped the holes
(in his basket) with leaves. Then they all returned to the village.
Ngamboma, by diverting a stream, caught a few fish and returned. When
they reached their houses the dead roasted the leaves which they called
fish, but when Ngamboma tried to roast them the leaves all burnt up.
Then Khuptingi said to Ngamboma, &lsquo;The others have caught so many
fish; why have you caught so few?&rsquo; Ngamboma roasted the real fish
which he had caught, but they burnt up just like the bamboo leaves.
Then one day the people again went out to hunt. In the place where they
went hunting they saw a huge black caterpillar; the dead called it a
bear. Ngamboma did not see it, and by accident trod on it and killed
it. Then the dead said to Ngamboma, &lsquo;That bear which ran towards
you, have you seen it?&rsquo; they said. Ngamboma&mdash;&lsquo;I have
not seen it,&rsquo; he said. Presently they saw the caterpillar which
he had trodden on, &lsquo;Hei-le! Why, you have shot it!&rsquo; they
said. They carried it up to the village and all the dead ate up its
flesh entirely. Ngamboma, however, did not care to eat any of it. Then
Khuptingi said to Ngamboma, &lsquo;Living people and dead people, we
shall not be able to live together comfortably; therefore, if you now
build yourself a house here and then return to your home, when you die
you will be able to live in it?&rsquo;&mdash;thus Khuptingi said. So he
set to work to build a house. The dead called the arum trees, and they
split them with axes and built (with them), but Ngamboma just split
those arums with his nail very quickly. &lsquo;Can one build houses
with such stuff?&rsquo; he said. Then, splitting real trees into
planks, he built his house. Then Khuptingi said to Ngamboma, &lsquo;If
you go to your house and call all the villagers together and sacrifice
a mithan, and when you have finished eating its flesh you put on very
good cloths and wear round your neck the sacrificial rope (the rope the
mithan was bound with), and call on my name, then you will die and will
be able to come to our village,&rsquo; she said. Just as Khuptingi said
it came to pass; he died as he was lying on his bed, then they were
able to live together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>with comfort. When he saw the
house that he had built in Mi-thi-khua, he said, &lsquo;Who built that
house?&rsquo; The dead said to him, &lsquo;You built it while you were
alive.&rsquo; Then they married in Mi-thi-khua, it is said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is because of this story of Ngamboma and
Khuptingi that we say nowadays people are in Mi-thi-khua.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE LAKHER OR MARA CLAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This clan emigrated from the neighbourhood of
Thlan-tlang (called by the Chin Hills officers Klang-klang) in
comparatively recent times. They are closely allied to the Southern
Chins, and a description of them belongs more properly to the Chin
Monograph. Much of the information in Messrs Carey and Tuck&rsquo;s
Gazetteer regarding the Southern Chins applies to the Lakhers. I
therefore propose to give only a brief description here.</p>
<p class="par">The clan calls itself Mara, Lakher being the name used
by the Lushais. The Chins, I believe, call them Zo, and the Arracan
name for them is Klongshai. The following extract from my diary, dated
10th February, 1891, gives a brief account of the advent of this
clan:&mdash;&ldquo;In the evening I had a long talk with the chiefs and
found out the origin, according to them, of the feud with the Mrungs
(in the Chittagong Hill tracts). In the lifetime of Thonglien&rsquo;s
father, the Bohmong of that time sent to ask the Mara clan to come and
make friends. A deputation went, taking with them two large elephant
tusks as a peace offering. The Bohmong had two of the party
treacherously killed, and hence the feud which has led to so much
bloodshed. I am told that the first Mara to come here (Saiha) were a
colony under one of Thonglien&rsquo;s ancestors. They came from
Thlan-tlang to where Vongthu now is, and then moved further east till
they settled somewhere on the Blue Mountain. Finding themselves too
small a colony to hold their own, they sent for the rest of the clan,
who, under Lianchi, Hmunklinga&rsquo;s great-grandfather, came and
settled where Ramri now is. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>a few years a few of the
Chinja tribe arrived and were received into the village. These were
followed by more and more until eventually the Mara left the Chinja in
possession of Ramri and moved across the Blue Mountain, where they have
remained ever since.&rdquo; There are other Lakher villages besides
those referred to in the above extract, and the clan is found in
considerable strength to the south of the Lushai Hills boundary, in
territory which is at present unadministered. Members of the clan are
also found in the Lushai and Chin villages adjoining the real Lakher
country, which lies in the loop of the Koladyne or Kaladan river, south
of latitude 22&deg;3&acute;.</p>
<p class="par">Their villages are more permanent than those of the
Lushais though the houses are built of the same materials, the
proximity of large supplies of bamboos having led the immigrants to
abandon the substantial timber buildings of the land of their origin
for more flimsy structures. The sites are, however, levelled and the
villages are seldom moved. Before the reign of peace which has followed
our occupation of the Hills, each village was surrounded by a triple
line of stockading or by an impenetrable belt of thorny jungle, through
which a narrow pathway, defended by three gates, led to the village.
Inside the houses the sleeping platforms of the Lushais are absent and
the hearth is in the middle of the floor. If the owner has slaves or a
married son, the interior is divided into compartments by partitions
which extend three-quarters of the way across the house.</p>
<p class="par">The men smoke but little, but much relish the nicotine
water from the women&rsquo;s pipes, which differ slightly in shape from
those used by their Lushai cousins.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Dress.</i>&mdash;I have been unable to detect any
difference in dress between the Lakhers and the Southern Chins. The men
wear a narrow loin-cloth twisted round the waist, one end being passed
between the legs and slipped under the waist-band, the only other
garment being a cloth about 7 feet by 5, worn as the Lushais wear
theirs, and made either of cotton or silk. Blue and white check cloths
are very much fancied, but are imported from Burma, whence also comes a
very rough cotton <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span>cloth with large brown checks. The silk
cloths are made by the women and are fine pieces of work, taking an
industrious woman as much as a year to weave.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The dress of the women is more elaborate&mdash;several
petticoats reaching almost to the ground and held up by a massive brass
girdle, made after the pattern of the chain of a cog-wheel. These
petticoats are generally of dark blue cotton, but sometimes the outer
one is a very elaborately worked piece of silk, similar in pattern to
the man&rsquo;s cloth. Each petticoat is merely a strip of cloth wide
enough to go one and a half times or even twice round the body.</p>
<p class="par">While clothing her nether extremities thus decently, the
Lakher woman wears a jacket which consists really of little more than
two very short sleeves joined at the back and tied loosely together in
front. This absurd little garment does not by several inches reach to
her petticoat. The jacket is generally of home-made cloth or silk of a
pattern similar to the men&rsquo;s cloths. A loose cloth of the
favourite blue and white check is wrapped round the body for warmth,
but discarded when any work is being done.</p>
<p class="par">The men wear the hair tied in a knot above the forehead.
A very narrow turban is often worn, being passed round the back of the
head low down and the ends twisted round the knot of hair. Chiefs
affect the high turban of the Thlan-tlangs.</p>
<p class="par">Women wear nothing on their heads, except in wet
weather, when both sexes wear hats like the Lushais. The raincoat of
the Chins is also used. Special cloths and plumes are worn by those who
have killed men or given certain feasts, as among the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ornaments.</i>&mdash;The amber necklaces so dear to
the Lushais do not find much favour with this clan, who value
especially necklaces of a stuff known as &ldquo;pumtek,&rdquo; but as
this is very rare, necklaces of glass-beads, cornelians, buttons,
coins, etc., are generally all that commoners can obtain. The women are
particularly fond of necklaces; the men wear but few, which is in
marked contrast to the custom of the Lushais.</p>
<p class="par">The men ornament their top-knots with combs, the backs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>of which are sometimes of ivory, sometimes of
wood lacquered in various patterns. A long pin of iron or bone is
always worn in the top-knot, and is used for scratching the head as
well as for cleaning out the pipe.</p>
<p class="par">The women wear their hair rolled round a very heavy
two-pronged brass skewer, the weight of which, sometimes as much as 3
lbs., keeps the hair low down on the nape of the neck.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Constitution of Society.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Lakhers, in common with the Chins, are less
democratic than the Lushais and their cognates. The power of the chiefs
is greater, and the chiefs&rsquo; relatives and other wealthy people
form a kind of peerage and lord it over the lesser fry, being seldom
interfered with unless their doings endanger the interests of the
chief. Slaves with the Lakhers are real slaves, not merely unpaid
servants as among the Lushais. A slave is the absolute property of his
master, and may be sold like any other possession. Female slaves are
not allowed to marry, but are encouraged to become mothers, as their
children are the property of their owners. Male slaves who win their
master&rsquo;s favour are sometimes married at their owner&rsquo;s
expense, but they and their children remain slaves. Parents and other
relations sell children when they are in pecuniary difficulties, and
captives taken in war are naturally the slaves of their captors.</p>
<p class="par">In the matter of marriage the Lakher&rsquo;s choice is
as little limited as that of the Lushai but, owing to the power of the
upper class, there is great competition to secure a bride of good
birth, and this leads to girls being married before they attain
puberty. After her marriage such a child-wife helps in the household of
her husband&rsquo;s mother, but sleeps with her own parents. The
following extract from a report on the Lakhers sent me by Mr. Whalley,
of the E. Bengal and Assam Police, cannot be improved
on:&mdash;&ldquo;The advanced age, as regards males, at which marriage
takes place is due to the recognised obligation on the part of every
male to marry the daughter of a house of higher standing than his own,
with the consequently disproportionate advance in the amount of the
marriage price. Too frequently a male on coming into his inheritance is
occupied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>during his years of vigour in paying off the
debt of his mother&rsquo;s marriage price, and can only afford to take
a wife of a higher station than his own when he is no longer capable of
becoming a father. In the interval he takes a concubine, generally of a
lower class than his own. On the other hand, the marriage or betrothal
of children by their parents is common. Such marriages are on two
scales. In both from the date of betrothal the bridegroom commences to
pay the marriage price in irregular instalments; in one, however, he
contracts, if he becomes a father by his bride, to pay the whole
marriage price, and can claim the return of all payments made if the
decease of his bride precedes such an event; in the other he pays only
a proportion of the whole fixed beforehand, which is not recoverable,
even if marriage is never consummated. The first is in more general
favour with parents, as even in the case of the death of the
prospective bride it is by no means certain that, in view of the
disparity in position of the families, the bridegroom will be able to
compel disgorgement of the instalments paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The above description of customs refers
<i>mutatis mutandis</i> to all classes of society except slaves. The
desirability of an unmarried girl varies directly with the social
position of the parents; appearance, industry, and chastity are
entirely subordinate factors, and exercise very little influence on the
marriage price demanded. There is a strange custom by which a husband
who finds his wife incompatible may exchange her for any of her sisters
still unmarried. A younger brother, again, whose parents are dead, even
though already married, takes over as a rule the wife as well as the
liability of an elder brother who has predeceased him. The precedence
of such wives should be regulated solely by the position of their
parents, and breaches of this rule, owing to the partiality of the
husband, lead frequently to bitter feuds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following valuable note on the marriage price of a
Lakher girl, and on the dues payable at death, by Mr. R. A. Lorrain, is
inserted just as received:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The important position occupied by the bride&rsquo;s
eldest brother and her maternal uncle are noticeable. <span class=

<p class="par">Needless to say, many of these prices are kept on
credit, and often have to be met after death by the son or the
son&rsquo;s son, making it a terribly complicated matter on the
whole.</p>
<p class="par signed"><span class="sc">Reginald A. Lorrain</span>,</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Offences against property and person can generally be
settled by payment of a fine, but the Lakhers have no fixed custom in
such matters, and a person of quality generally takes the law into his
own hands if he considers himself aggrieved.</p>
<p class="par">Head-hunting used to be indulged in and is still
practised by the Lakhers in unadministered tracks. In case of a
chief&rsquo;s death it was proper to kill someone of a distant village
before drums or gongs were beaten, but it was thought
&ldquo;thianglo&rdquo; to bring back the head on such an occasion. As
regards their religious beliefs, the Lakher equivalent of Pathian is
Khazang. Mr. Whalley writes:&mdash;&ldquo;All spirits, with one
doubtful exception to be noted later, whether malignant or benign, are
slaves of the great spirit Khazang or Loitha. Whereas the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>attributes and the names of the lesser spirits
vary from village to village and individual to individual, this great
spirit has a firmer outline and permits of some attempt at description.
The picture they draw is primitive, almost touching in its
childishness. The Khazang or Loitha is small and brown and almost
hairless. He is capable of sexual love and has children. He is material
in his essence, but superior to natural laws such as those of time,
space, and gravity. He is immortal, and has an immaterial wife and
immaterial children. For his continuance the world exists with its
revenue. In their own phrase he &lsquo;eats&rsquo; the domains of the
lesser spirits through all nature as a chief &lsquo;eats&rsquo;
villages (<i>i.e.</i>, receives tribute in supplies from villages). He
regards individual men much as these same men regard individual ants.
Nearer to the heart and farther from the intelligence of the Lakhers is
the mysterious Pi-leh-pu, the all-mother and all-father (strictly
translated &lsquo;grandmother&rsquo; and &lsquo;grandfather,&rsquo; the
term is generally used for ancestors)&mdash;a being not
anthropomorphised or materialised, partaking in some shadowy way of the
functions both of guardian angel and of originator of the human
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the course of my enquiries I did not come across any
references to Pi-leh-pu, but there seems good reason to think that the
term is applied to the mythical ancestor of the clan. In the Lushai
Mi-thi-rawp-lam, it will be remembered that in the centre of the frame
round which the effigies of the ancestors of the celebrants are
fastened there is a white effigy to represent the mythical ancestor of
the whole clan. In some respects Pi-leh-pu seems to resemble the Lushai
Sakhua.</p>
<p class="par">The Ram-huai of the Lushais are known as
&ldquo;Hri-pa&rdquo; and the L&#257;shi as &ldquo;Sakhia.&rdquo; After
death the spirits pass to Mi-thi-khua, the road to which is by the
village of Lunchoi and passes up a precipice. It is so narrow that
women with child have to widen it as they go, for which purpose a hoe
is buried with them, or at least laid beside the corpse during the
funeral feast. Pial-ral is called &ldquo;Pe-ra&rsquo;,&rdquo; and to
reach it all sorts of animals must be killed and the Ai ceremony
performed for each. The Khuangchoi feast is also considered, if not
absolutely necessary, at least very useful. Triumphs in the courts of
Venus will not help the spirit to pass to Pe-ra&rsquo;. Women can only
reach that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>happy place if their husbands take them. A
series of feasts or sacrifices closely resembling the Thangchhuah feast
of the Lushais is performed, but I was assured that the
performer&rsquo;s state in the next world was not in any way affected
thereby, the feasts being equivalent to the Lushai Sakhua sacrifice.
The series consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Vok-rial.&mdash;A very small pig which has been brought
up in the house is killed and eaten.</p>
<p class="par">Vok-pa.&mdash;A boar of five fists&rsquo; height which
has been brought up in the house is killed, a black hen being also
sacrificed at the same time.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; are kept inside the house for
three days, during which time none of the household may do any work,
but the house is not closed and anyone may share in the feast. The
Vok-rial is performed three times and the Vok-pa twice, and then a
mithan is killed and all share in the feast. The performer of the
She-shun may not cross a big stream or enter another village till he
has sacrificed a hen. Subsequently he again performs Vok-rial, which is
said to conclude the sacrifices to Sakhua. A feast in which two mithan
are killed is called &ldquo;Bawi.&rdquo; It is followed by Khuangchoi,
in which at least five mithan must be slain.</p>
<p class="par">The spirits of the dead are supposed to become mist
after having lived two or three lives in the other world.</p>
<p class="par">Ten days after the birth of a child the mother goes to
the water supply and washes herself. She then takes the child to her
father&rsquo;s house, where she receives some rice and a fowl, which
she takes home and eats. Sacrifices are not done at this time.
Children&rsquo;s heads are shaved at three months, and the hair is
allowed to grow at nine years with girls and at eleven with boys. The
bodies of stillborn children are buried outside the village without any
ceremony, but no purification, either of the house or village, is
considered necessary.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="marginnote">Death.</span> The usual funeral
feast, which in the case of wealthy persons may last three to five
days, precedes the burial. Some time afterwards a second feast is given
and a portion is put aside for the spirit of the deceased. At the
funeral feast the corpse is laid out with fine cloths and ornaments and
a dance is performed by two women and one man. In other respects the
Lakher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>and Lushai customs are very much alike. There is
an annual feast in honour of those who have died during the year. It is
called &ldquo;Lachhia.&rdquo; A pig is killed and the young men and
maidens dance attired in their best clothes, and the usual large
quantities of zu are consumed.</p>
<div class="figure xd24e7840width" id="p223"><img src="images/p223.jpg"

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In cases of unnatural death no one may leave the village
till the sixth day. On the fourth day a hen is sacrificed outside the
village. The corpse is buried beyond the village boundary fence. Deaths
in childbirth are considered unnatural deaths. If the firstborn in a
family dies within a few days of its birth the corpse is buried
anywhere, without ceremony, and the household abstain from work for one
day. Such a death is called &ldquo;naw-dawng&rdquo; (Lushai
&ldquo;hlamzuih&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="par">Many of the Lushai sacrifices are performed. The
Kh&#257;l takes the following form:&mdash;A fowl is killed at the head
of the bed in the name of the father, a month later one is killed in
the name of the mother, and in successive months one is killed for each
child. The flesh of these fowls can only be eaten by the parents. The
Uihring sacrifice is known as &ldquo;An-hmu&rdquo;; a dog is killed
outside the house, the hills inhabited by their ancestors being named.
The &ldquo;sherh&rdquo; are hung on a tree or a bamboo. The husbands of
women who are enceinte may not enter the house on such occasions. The
following sacrifices of the Lushais are not
performed&mdash;Hring-ai-tan, Khuavanghring, Tui-leh-ram, Bawlpui. In
the Thla-ko a cock is killed outside the village and the spirit is
summoned. Khawhring is unknown, and they maintain that there are no
wizards or witches among them.</p>
<p class="par">There are three festivals connected with the
crops&mdash;(1) &ldquo;Kicheo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kutsa-zawng,&rdquo;
which takes place in January; feasting and drinking are the main
features of this festival, which is preceded by a general hunt, as the
flesh of wild animals, birds, or land crabs is absolutely necessary.
(2) &ldquo;Paku,&rdquo; which comes just before the sowing of the rice,
closely resembles the Lushai Chap-ch&#257;r-kut. (3)
&ldquo;Lalia&rdquo;&mdash;this corresponds to the Lushai Mimkut; the
children are fed with maize cakes, and if any member of the family has
died within the previous year some cakes are put aside for his
spirit.</p>
<p class="par">The superstitions of the Lakhers resemble those of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>Lushais. To kill a python is sure to result in
the death of the killer. Even to see a loris is unlucky and to kill one
is fatal. The sight of two snakes copulating will also be followed by
serious illness, if not by death. The Lushai Chawifa is known as
&ldquo;Thla-shi-pu,&rdquo; and if it falls in the jungle that is the
place to cut your jhum, for then you are sure of a good crop. It seems
that Thla-shi-pu is merely a meteor; the Lakhers have not surrounded
this natural phenomenon with the myths which the more imaginative
Lushais delight in. In choosing the site for a village a cock is taken,
and if it does not crow the site will not be selected, but if one of
the party dream of dead persons or bad things this is also sufficient
cause for rejecting the site.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Lakhers there are no priests of any sort;
every man is his own priest. At the marriage ceremony the fowl is
killed by the man who has arranged the match. <span class=

<h2 class="main">LANGUAGE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The languages of all the clans dealt with in this
monograph, except the Lakher, are very similar, and also bear a strong
resemblance to those of their neighbours.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Grierson, in the &ldquo;Linguistic Survey of
India,&rdquo; uses the term &ldquo;Kuki-Chin&rdquo; to describe all the
languages spoken by the clans I have dealt with and their cognates, but
he adds:&mdash;&ldquo;Meithei-Chin would be a better appellation, as
the whole group can be sub-divided into two sub-groups, the Meitheis
(Manipuris) and the various tribes which are known to us under the
names of Kuki and Chin.&rdquo; Dr. Grierson considers that all the
Kuki-Chin languages belong to the Burmese branch of the Tibeto-Burman
family, and he subdivides them as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">I. Meithei,*<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7869src" href=
"#xd24e7869" name="xd24e7869src">1</a> or Manipuri.</p>
<p class="par">II. Chin languages&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Northern group: Thado, Sokte,* Siyin,* Ralte, and Paite or
Vuite.</li>
<li>2. Central group: Tashon,* Lai,* Lakher, Lushai, Banjogi,* and
Pankhu.*</li>
<li>3. Old Kuki group: Rhangkhol, Bete (Biate), Hallam, Langrong,
Aimol, Anal, Chiru, Lamgang, Kolren (Kolhen), Kom, Purum, Mhar (Hmar or
Khawtlang), and Cha.*</li>
<li>4. Southern group: Chinme,* Welaung,* Chinbok,* Yindu,* Chinbon,*
Khyang or Sho,* Khami.*</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">With reference to the connection between the different
clans, Dr. Grierson writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The terms Old Kuki and New
Kuki are apt to convey the idea that the tribes so denoted are closely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>related to each other. But that is not the case.
Not only do their customs and institutions differ considerably, but
their languages are separated by a large group of dialects in the
Lushai and Chin Hills, and the so-called New Kukis (Thados) are, so far
as we can see, a Chin tribe, most closely connected to the inhabitants
of the northern Chin Hills, while the Old Kukis are related to tribes
more to the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The account of the causes of the Old and New Kuki
incursions into Cachar, given in Part I, Chap. I, Section 3, which was
written before I had read Dr. Grierson&rsquo;s book, agrees entirely
with his conclusions.</p>
<p class="par">A detailed account has been given in Part I of the
Lushai language, and, considering the full manner in which the dialects
of all these tribes have been dealt with by Dr. Grierson in the
&ldquo;Linguistic Survey of India,&rdquo; it seems superfluous to
attempt to give outlines of them, and therefore I propose only to draw
attention to the many points of similarity between them. The works I
have consulted are:&mdash;&ldquo;The Linguistic Survey of India,&rdquo;
Vol. II, Part III, Lorrain and Savidge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grammar and
Dictionary of the Lushai Language,&rdquo; Mr. T. C. Hodson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Grammar and Small Vocabulary of Thado,&rdquo; and the appendix
to Lieutenant Stewart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes on Northern Cachar,&rdquo;
1855.</p>
<p class="par">In going through Mr. Hodson&rsquo;s vocabulary of the
Thado language, the first thing that struck me was the absence of the
letter R. Further examination showed that where R is used in Lushai and
certain other languages G or Gh is substituted in Thado. Many instances
of this will be found in the following comparative vocabulary.</p>
<p class="par">In many cases F in Lushai, Rhangkhol, and Langrong is
replaced by Ch, sometimes softened into S in Thado, Manipuri, and some
Old Kuki dialects. I have so far only found the following examples, but
the material at my disposal is very insufficient, and I have no doubt
that, given complete vocabularies, many more would be found:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fa&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;cha&rdquo; in
Manipuri and Thado, meaning &ldquo;child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;F&#257;r-nu&rdquo; in Lushai and Langrong,
&ldquo;ch&#257;r-nu&rdquo; in Aimol, Kolhen and Lamgang,
&ldquo;s&#257;r-nu&rdquo; in Chiru, Kom, and Hallam, meaning
&ldquo;sister.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;F&#257;k&rdquo; in Langrong,
&ldquo;ch&#257;k&rdquo; in Manipuri, &ldquo;cha&rdquo; in Aimol, Anal,
Kolhen, Lamgang, &ldquo;sh&#257;k&rdquo; in Chiru, meaning &ldquo;to
eat.&rdquo; In Lushai we have &ldquo;chaw-f&#257;k-hun,&rdquo;
&ldquo;rice-eat-time.&rdquo; Until I found that &ldquo;f&#257;k&rdquo;
meant &ldquo;to eat&rdquo; in Langrong, the Lushai equivalent for
dinner-time had always puzzled me, as the Lushai word for &ldquo;to
eat&rdquo; is &ldquo;ei.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fawp&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;chop&rdquo; in
Thado, &ldquo;chup&rdquo; in Purum, meaning &ldquo;to kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;F&#257;ng&rdquo; in Bete,
&ldquo;ch&#257;ng&rdquo; in Thado, meaning &ldquo;paddy,&rdquo; while
&ldquo;f&#257;ng&rdquo; in Lushai means &ldquo;a grain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fep&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;chep&rdquo; in
Thado, meaning &ldquo;to suck,&rdquo; as sugar-cane.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Feh&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;to go to the
jhums,&rdquo; &ldquo;feh&rdquo; in Rhangkhol, &ldquo;to go&rdquo;;
&ldquo;che&rdquo; in Thado, Aimol, and Anal, and &ldquo;chatpa&rdquo;
in Manipuri have the same meaning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fing&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;ching&rdquo; in
Thado, &ldquo;singba&rdquo; in Manipuri, mean &ldquo;wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fu&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;chu&rdquo; in Thado
mean &ldquo;sugar-cane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fang-hma&rdquo; in Lushai, &ldquo;fung-mat&rdquo;
in Bete, &ldquo;chung-mai&rdquo; in Thado, mean &ldquo;a
pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">N in Lushai sometimes becomes &ldquo;shi&rdquo; in Lai
or Haka dialect, as &ldquo;ni&rdquo; in Lushai and &ldquo;shi&rdquo; in
Lai, meaning both &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and &ldquo;aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">G and K are often interchanged and also R, L, and N.</p>
<p class="par">In Lushai we have &ldquo;lung&rdquo; meaning both
&ldquo;stone&rdquo; and &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; while in Manipuri we have
&ldquo;nung&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; and though
&ldquo;heart&rdquo; is translated by &ldquo;puk,&rdquo; we have
&ldquo;nung-siba&rdquo; &ldquo;to be sad,&rdquo; evidently composed of
&ldquo;nung&rdquo; and &ldquo;siba,&rdquo; &ldquo;to die,&rdquo; and
also &ldquo;nung-ngaiba,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;happy,&rdquo; showing
that &ldquo;nung&rdquo; once meant heart.</p>
<p class="par">In many of these languages, similar words are used but
have slightly different meanings. For instance, &ldquo;shang&rdquo; in
Lushai means &ldquo;tall,&rdquo; while in Thado and Manipuri we have
&ldquo;sang&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Leng&rdquo; in Lushai means &ldquo;to
stroll,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lengba&rdquo; in Manipuri means &ldquo;to
walk,&rdquo; but is only used of important personages who would be
likely to move slowly and in a dignified manner.</p>
<p class="par">In Lushai &ldquo;sh&#257;t&rdquo; means &ldquo;to
cut,&rdquo; but as a Lushai&rsquo;s house <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>consists of timber
and bamboos, he always uses &ldquo;sh&#257;t&rdquo; when he speaks of
building a house, and we find &ldquo;sha&rdquo; in Thado and
&ldquo;s&#257;ba&rdquo; in Manipuri mean &ldquo;to make,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to build.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In Lushai the verb &ldquo;ni,&rdquo; &ldquo;to
be,&rdquo; is conjugated completely, but in Manipuri &ldquo;ni&rdquo;
means &ldquo;is&rdquo; and has no other tenses.</p>

<p class="par">The following comparative vocabulary gives in the first
two columns the Thado and English words as given by Mr. Hodson. The
first word in the column of remarks is always Lushai, and where it has
not exactly the same meaning as the Thado word the correct meaning is
given; then follow, where necessary, the equivalents in other
dialects.</p>
<p class="par">About one word in every three given in Mr.
Hodson&rsquo;s vocabulary has been found to resemble closely the Lushai
word having the same or a similar meaning. Mr. Hodson&rsquo;s
vocabulary has no pretensions to be a complete dictionary of the Thado
language. Were such available I believe the number of similar words in
the two dialects would be found to be even greater. As regards the Old
Kuki dialects the information available is not sufficient to make a
thorough comparison. It is clear that they are very closely allied to
Lushai and Thado and to each other. The connection between Manipuri and
what Dr. Grierson calls the Chin languages will, I believe, be found on
further enquiry to be closer than at first appears. <span class=

Sa-kei, a tiger; while Kel, a goat, Shial, a mithan, Ui, a dog, have no
prefix. Sa is used in the same manner in Manipuri&mdash;Sagol, a horse;
Sangamba, an otter; Saji, a barking deer, &amp;c. The word is found in
